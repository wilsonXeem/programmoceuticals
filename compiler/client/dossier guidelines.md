  Profound international harmonization has been achieved on the regulatory
  requirements for the registration of medicinal products for human use through the
  ICH processes and the development of the CTD. The CTD is a widely accepted format
  for regulatory submission and allows applicants to prepare product dossiers without
  unnecessarily changing information that may have been submitted to other medicines
  authorities.
  Scope
  This guidelines document has been developed in pursuance to the NAFDAC act Cap.
  N1, LFN 2014 and made to provide guidance to applicants on the organization of
  information to be provided to the agency in seeking marketing authorization for
  medicinal products for human use. It also provides guidance to industry on the
  expectations of NAFDAC as it concerns submission of product dossiers in CTD format.
  Applicants are encouraged to read these guidelines in conjunction with other relevant
  rules and regulations before filing a submission to the Agency.

  GLOSSARY / DEFINITIONS
  Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)
  Any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a
  pharmaceutical dosage form and that, when so used, becomes an active ingredient of
  that pharmaceutical dosage form. Such substances are intended to furnish
  pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
  treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure and function of the body.
  Authorized person
  The person recognized by the National Regulatory Authority as having the
  responsibility for ensuring that each batch of finished product has been manufactured,
  tested and approved for release in compliance with the laws and regulations in force
  in that country.
  Batch records
  All documents associated with the manufacture of a batch of bulk product or finished
  product. They provide a history of each batch of product and of all circumstances
  pertinent to the quality of the final product.
  Bio-equivalence:
  The absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active
  ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical
  alternatives becomes available at the site of action when administered at the same
  molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study.
  Bulk Product:
  Any product that has completed all processing and steps up to, but not including final
  packaging. Related terms – Intermediate, Finished Product
  Page ii of 94
  Drug Master File
  A drug master file (DMF) is a master file that provides a full set of data on an API. In
  some countries, the term may also comprise data on an excipient or a component of
  a product such as a container.
  Drug Substance
  Another term used for the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient
  Finished product
  A finished dosage form that has undergone all stages of manufacture, including
  packaging in its final container and labelling. Related terms – Intermediate Product,
  Bulk Product.
  Generic Products
  The term generic product has somewhat different meanings in different jurisdictions.
  Use of this term has therefore been avoided as far as possible, and the term
  multisource pharmaceutical product is used instead (see the definition below).
  Multisource products may be marketed either under the approved non-proprietary
  name or under a brand (proprietary) name. They may be marketed in dosage forms
  and/or strengths different to those of the innovator products.
  Where the term generic product is used, it means a pharmaceutical product, usually
  intended to be interchangeable with the innovator product, which is usually
  manufactured without a licence from the innovator company and marketed after
  expiry of the patent or other exclusivity rights. The term should not be confused with
  generic names for APIs.
  Intermediate product
  Partly processed product that must undergo further manufacturing steps before it
  becomes a bulk product. Related terms – Bulk Product, Finished Product.
  Manufacture
  All operations of purchase of materials and products, production, quality control,
  release, storage and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and the related controls.
  Page 3
  Marketing authorization (product license, registration certificate)
  A legal document issued by the competent drug Regulatory Authority that establishes
  the detailed composition and formulation of the product and the pharmacopoeia or
  other recognized specifications of its ingredients and of the final product itself, and
  includes details of packaging, labelling and shelf-life.
  Master formula
  A document or set of documents specifying the starting materials with their quantities
  and the packaging materials, together with a description of the procedures and
  precautions required to produce a specified quantity of a finished product as well as
  the processing instructions, including the in-process controls.
  Master record
  A document or set of documents that serve as a basis for the batch documentation.
  Multisource (Generic) Product
  Multi source are pharmaceutically equivalent, same amount of the same API, same
  dosage form, meet the same comparable standards, intended to be administered by
  the same route. Only multisource products that are therapeutically equivalent are
  interchangeable.
  Pharmaceutical product (PD)
  Any material or product intended for human or veterinary use presented in its finished
  dosage form or as a starting material for use in such a dosage form that is subject to
  control by pharmaceutical legislation in the exporting state and/or the importing state.
  Production
  All operations involved in the preparation of a pharmaceutical product, from receipt of
  materials, through processing, packaging and repackaging, labelling and re-labelling,
  to completion of the finished product.
  Page 4
  Specification
  Lists of detailed requirements with which the products or materials used or obtained
  during manufacture have to conform. They serve as a basis for quality evaluation.
  Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
  An authorized written procedure giving instructions for performing operations not
  necessarily specific to a given product or material (e.g. equipment operation,
  maintenance and cleaning; validation; cleaning of premises and environmental
  control; sampling and inspection).
  Certain SOPs may be used to supplement product-specific master and batch
  production documentation.
  Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA)
  A stringent regulatory authority (SRA): a regulatory authority which is:
   a member of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) (as specified
  on www.ich.org); or
   an ICH observer, being the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), as
  represented by SwissMedic, and Health Canada (as may be updated from time to
  time); or
   a regulatory authority associated with an ICH member through a legally-binding,
  mutual recognition agreement including Australia, Iceland, Liechtenstein and
  Norway (as may be updated from time to time).

  GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PRESENTATION
  Language
  Applications for products seeking marketing authorization shall be submitted in English.
  In cases where there is the need to translate a document from its original language to
  English, the accuracy of the translations is the responsibility of the applicant and the
  translations shall be authenticated by a certified expert in the country of origin.
  Data Presentation
  Dossiers should be submitted in electronic form and should follow the CTD format. Separate
  folders should be created for the different modules and sub-folders for the different sections
  of the CTD within each module. The documents should be submitted in searchable PDF
  format with the exception of the QIS which should be in MS Word.
  References and Texts
  International standards for citing references in any parts of the dossier must be followed.
  The latest edition of any reference source, specifying the year of publication must be used.
  Literature references should be cited in accordance with the current edition of the Uniform
  Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, International Committee
  of Medical Journals Editors (ICMJE).
  Acronyms and abbreviations should be defined the first time they are used in each module.
  Where necessary, especially for analytical methods, specifications and procedures, copies
  of the relevant portions of the reference source(s) must be includes.
  All in-house processes quoted in the documentation must have been validated and
  appropriate references cited.
  To facilitate the preparation of the PD, these guidelines are organized in accordance with
  the structure of the ICH Common technical document – quality (M4Q) guideline.
  Page 6
  The text of the M4Q (CTD-Q) guideline has been restated verbatim in these guidelines in
  bold text, with minor modifications to accommodate NAFDAC terminology and to include
  certain text that would be appropriate for pharmaceutical products, notably:
  a) “Drug substance” is replaced with “active pharmaceutical ingredient” or “API”
  b) “Drug product” is replaced with “finished pharmaceutical product” or “FPP”.
  c) “Application” is replaced with “product dossier” or “PD”.
  d) “Combination product” is replaced with “fixed-dose combination” or “FDC”.
  Additional guidance by NAFDAC which is derived from the WHO Guidelines on submission
  of documentation for a multisource (generic) finished product, following the bold text
  reproduced from the M4Q (CTD-Q) guideline (2), is printed in normal text to make it easily
  distinguishable from the ICH text and is included to provide further clarity on NAFDAC’s
  expectations for the content of PDs. This approach is intended to facilitate the identification
  and origin of the text in these guidelines (i.e. from ICH or from WHO).
  The content of these guidelines should be read in conjunction with relevant information
  described in other existing WHO or ICH reference documents and guidelines. The quality of
  existing APIs and corresponding multisource products should not be inferior to new APIs
  and innovator (comparator) FPPs. Therefore, the principles of the ICH guidelines that are
  referenced throughout this document and in other WHO guidelines may equally apply to
  existing APIs and multisource products.
  Scientific literature may be appropriate to fulfil the requirements for some of the information
  or parameters outlined in these guidelines (e.g. qualification of specified identified
  impurities). Furthermore, the requirements outlined in certain sections may not be
  applicable to the proposed API or FPP. In these situations, either a summary or the full
  reference to the scientific literature should be provided, or the non-applicability of the
  requested information should be clearly indicated with an accompanying explanatory note.
  Page 7
  Guidance on format
  The recommendations outlined in the WHO general filing guideline Guidelines on
  submission of documentation for a multisource (generic) finished product: general format:
  preparation of product dossiers in common technical document format should be followed
  for the format and presentation of the PD.
  There may be a number of instances where repetition of sections can be considered
  appropriate. Whenever a section is repeated, it should be made clear what the section
  refers to by creating a distinguishing title in parentheses following the M4Q (CTD-Q)
  guideline heading, e.g. 3.2.S Drug substance (or API) (name, Manufacturer A).
  The following are recommendations for the presentation of the information in the Quality
  module for different scenarios that may be encountered:
   The Open part (non-proprietary information) of each APIMF should always be included
  in its entirety in the PD, as an annex to 3.2.S.
   For an FPP containing more than one API, one complete “3.2.S” section should be
  provided for one API, followed by another complete “3.2.S” section for each of the
  other APIs.
   For an API from multiple manufacturers, one complete “3.2.S” section should be
  provided for the API from one manufacturer, followed by another complete “3.2.S”
  section for the API from each of the other API manufacturers.
   For an FPP with multiple strengths (e.g. 10, 50, 100 mg) one complete “3.2.P” section
  should be provided with the information for the different strengths provided within the
  subsections. One complete copy of the PD should be provided for each FPP strength.
   For an FPP with multiple container-closure systems (e.g. bottles and unit dose blisters)
  one complete “3.2.P” section should be provided with the information for the different
  presentations provided within the subsections.
   For multiple FPPs (e.g. tablets and a parenteral product) a separate dossier is required
  for each FPP.
  Page 8
   For an FPP supplied with reconstitution diluent(s) one complete “3.2.P” section should
  be provided for the FPP, followed by the information on the diluent(s) in a separate
  part “3.2.P”, as appropriate.
   For a co-blistered FPP one complete “3.2.P” section should be provided for each
  product.
  STRUCTURE OF THE CTD FORMAT
  Information within the CTD is organized into a series of structured documents which are in
  turn organized into modules. The M4 guidance Organization of the Common Technical
  Document and ICH General Questions and Answers provides the definition of a document
  and guidance on Table of Contents (ToC) formatting, cross-referencing within the CTD and
  for document pagination, segregation and section numbering.

  2.4. Non-Clinical Overview
  The Nonclinical Overview should provide an integrated overall analysis of the
  information in the Module 4. In general, the Nonclinical Overview should not exceed
  about 30 pages.
  The Nonclinical Overview should be presented in the following sequence:
   Overview of the nonclinical testing strategy
   Pharmacology
   Pharmacokinetics
   Toxicology
   Integrated overview and conclusions
   List of literature references
  The Integrated Overview and Conclusions should clearly define the characteristics of
  the human pharmaceutical as demonstrated by the nonclinical studies and arrive at
  logical, well-argued conclusions supporting the safety of the product for the intended
  clinical use. Taking the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology results into
  account, the implications of the nonclinical findings for the safe human use of the
  pharmaceutical should be discussed (i.e., as applicable to labelling).
  ICH M4S (R2) Module 2.4 provides guidance for the contents of the Non-clinical
  Overview. The non-clinical information in Module 2.4 and Module 4 is not normally
  required for multisource (generic) drug products. However in some cases such as
  changes in safety impurity profile, the safety assessment studies should be
  conducted.
  Page 19
  2.5 Clinical Overview
  The Clinical Overview is intended to provide a critical analysis of the clinical data in
  the Common Technical Document. The Clinical Overview will necessarily refer to
  application data provided in the comprehensive Clinical Summary, the individual
  clinical study reports (ICH E3), and other relevant reports; but it should primarily
  present the conclusions and implications of those data and should not recapitulate
  them.
  Specifically, the Clinical Summary should provide a detailed factual summarization of
  the clinical information in the CTD, and the Clinical Overview should provide a
  succinct discussion and interpretation of these findings together with any other
  relevant information (e.g., pertinent animal data or product quality issues that may
  have clinical implications).
  The clinical overview should be presented in the following order:
  Table of Contents
  2.5.1 Product Development Rationale
  2.5.2 Overview of Biopharmaceutics
  2.5.3 Overview of Clinical Pharmacology
  2.5.4 Overview of Efficacy
  2.5.5 Overview of Safety

  Information on the
  3.2.S Active pharmaceutical ingredient sections, including
  full details of chemistry, manufacturing process, quality controls during
  manufacturing and process validation for the API, should be submitted in the
  PD as outlined in the subsequent sections of these guidelines. The QOS-PD
  should be completed according to section 3.1 of these Guidelines.
  3.2. S.1 General Information (name, manufacturer)
  3.2. S.1.1 Nomenclature (name, manufacturer)
  Information on the nomenclature of the drug substance should be
  provided. For
  example:
   Recommended International Non-proprietary Name (INN);
   Compendial name if relevant;
   Chemical name(s);
   Company or laboratory code;
   Other non-proprietary name(s), e.g., national name, United States
  Adopted Name (USAN), Japanese Accepted Name (JAN); British
  Approved Name (BAN), and Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS)
  registry number.
  Page 25
  The chemical names listed should be consistent with those appearing in the scientific
  literature and those appearing on the product labelling information (e.g. in the
  summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and package leaflet, also known as the
  patient information leaflet (PIL)). Where several names exist the preferred name
  should be indicated.
  3.2. S.1.2 Structure (name, manufacturer)
  The structural formula, including relative and absolute stereochemistry,
  the molecular formula, and the relative molecular mass should be
  provided.
  This information should be consistent with that provided in section 3.2. S.1.1. for
  APIs existing as salts the molecular mass of the free base or acid should also be
  provided.
  3.2. S.1.3 General Properties (name, manufacturer)
  The structure, molecular formula, molecular weight and structural formula
  are specified. The chiral centres if any are identified.
  This information can be used in developing the specifications, in formulating FPPs
  and in the testing for release and stability purposes.
  The physical and chemical properties of the API should be discussed, including the
  physical description, solubilities in common solvents (e.g. water, alcohols,
  dichloromethane and acetone), quantitative aqueous pH solubility profile (e.g. pH
  1.2–6.8, dose/solubility volume), polymorphism, pH and pKa values, ultraviolet (UV)
  absorption maxima and molar absorptivity, melting point, refractive index (for a
  liquid), hygroscopicity and partition coefficient (see table in the QOS-PD). This list is
  not intended to be exhaustive but provides an indication as to the type of information
  that could be included.
  Page 26
  Some of the most relevant properties to be considered for APIs are discussed below
  in greater detail.
  Physical description
  The physical description should include appearance, colour and physical state. Solid
  forms should be identified as being crystalline or amorphous (see 3.2.S.3.1 for
  further information on API solid forms).
  Solubilities and quantitative aqueous pH solubility profile
  The following should be provided for all options for the submission of API data.
  The solubilities in a number of common solvents should be provided (e.g. in water,
  alcohols, dichloromethane and acetone).
  The solubilities over the physiological pH range (pH 1.2–6.8) in several buffered
  media should be provided in mg/ml. If this information is not readily available (e.g.
  from literature references), it should be generated in-house.
  For solid oral dosage forms, the dose/solubility volume should be provided as
  determined according to the formula:
  Largest dosage strength (mg)
  Dose/solubility volume =
  The minimum concentration of the drug (mg/ml) \*

* corresponding to the lowest solubility determined over the physiological pH range
  (pH 1.2–6.8) and temperature (37 ± 0.5 °C).
  According to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), highly soluble
  (or highly water soluble) APIs are those with a dose/solubility volume of ≤ 250 ml.
  For example, compound A has as its lowest solubility at 37 ± 0.5°C, 1.0 mg/ml
  at pH 6.8 and is available in 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg strengths. This API would
  not be considered a BCS highly soluble API as its dose/solubility volume is greater
  than 250 ml (400 mg/1.0 mg/ml = 400 ml).
  Page 27
  Polymorphism
  As recommended in ICH’s CTD-Q Questions and answers/location issues document (5) the
  following list explains where specific data should be located in the PD:
  ■ The polymorphic form(s) present in the proposed API should be listed in section
  3.2. S.1.3.
  ■ The description of manufacturing process and process controls (3.2.S.2.2) should
  indicate which polymorphic form is manufactured, where relevant.
  ■ The literature references or studies performed to identify the potential
  polymorphic forms of the API, including the study results, should be provided in
  section 3.2. S.3.1.
  ■ If a polymorphic form is to be defined or limited (e.g. for APIs that are not BCS
  highly soluble and/or where polymorphism has been identified as an issue),
  details should be included in 3.2.S.4.1– 3.2. S.4.5.
  Additional information is included in the referenced sections of these guidelines.
  Particle size distribution
  As recommended in ICH’s CTD-Q Questions and answers/location issues document (5), the
  studies performed to determine the particle size distribution of the API should be provided
  in section 3.2.S.3.1 (refer to this section of these guidelines for additional information).
  Information from the literature
  Supportive data and results from specific studies or published literature can be included
  within or attached to this section.
  Refer to ICH Guidelines: Q6A and Q6B
  Page 28
  3.2. S.2 Manufacture (name, manufacturer)
  3.2. S.2.1 Manufacturer(s) (name, manufacturer)
  The name, address, and responsibility of each manufacturer, including
  contractors, and each proposed production site or facility involved in
  manufacturing and testing should be provided.
  The facilities involved in the manufacturing, packaging, labelling, testing and storage
  of the API should be listed. If certain companies are responsible only for specific
  steps (e.g. milling of the API) this should be clearly indicated.
  The list of manufacturers or companies should specify the actual addresses of the
  production or manufacturing site(s) involved (including block(s) and units(s)), rather
  than the administrative offices. Telephone number(s), fax number(s) and e-mail
  address (es) should be provided.
  A valid manufacturing authorization should be provided for the production of APIs.
  If available, a certificate of compliance with GMP should be provided in the PD in
  Module 1.
  3.2. S.2.2 Description of manufacturing process and process controls (name,
  Manufacturer)
  The description of the API manufacturing process represents the
  applicant’s commitment for the manufacture of the API. Information
  should be provided to adequately describe the manufacturing process and
  process controls. For example:
  A flow diagram of the synthetic process(es) should be provided that
  includes molecular formulas, weights, yield ranges, chemical structures of
  Page 29
  starting materials, intermediates, reagents and API reflecting
  stereochemistry, and identifies operating conditions and solvents.
  A sequential procedural narrative of the manufacturing process should be
  submitted. The narrative should include, for example, quantities of raw
  materials, solvents, catalysts and reagents reflecting the representative
  batch scale for commercial manufacture, identification of critical steps,
  process controls, equipment and operating conditions (e.g. temperature,
  pressure, pH, and time).
  Alternative processes should be explained and described with the same
  level of detail as the primary process. Reprocessing steps should be
  identified and justified. Any data to support this justification should be
  either referenced or filed in 3.2.S.2.5.
  Where the APIMF procedure is used, a cross-reference to the Restricted part of the
  APIMF may be indicated for confidential information. In this case, if detailed
  information is presented in the Restricted part, the information to be provided for
  this section of the PD includes a flow chart (including molecular structures and all
  reagents and solvents) and a brief outline of the manufacturing process, with special
  emphasis on the final steps, including purification procedures. However, for sterile
  APIs, full validation data on the sterilization process should be provided in the Open
  part (in cases where there is no further sterilization of the final product).
  The following requirements apply to the fourth option for submission of API
  information, where full details are provided in the dossier.
  As discussed in ICH Q7 and WHO Technical Report Series, No. 957, Annex 2, the
  point at which the API starting material is introduced into the manufacturing process
  Page 30
  is the starting point for the application of GMP requirements. The API starting
  material itself needs to be proposed and its choice justified by the manufacturer and
  accepted as such by assessors. The API starting material should be proposed taking
  into account the complexity of the molecule, the proximity of the API starting
  material to the final API, the availability of the API starting material as a commercial
  chemical and the quality controls placed upon the API starting material. This
  justification should be documented in the dossier and be available for review by
  NAFDAC GMP inspectors.
  In situations where the API starting material is a complex molecule and only a
  minimal number of synthetic steps from the final API, a further molecule called the
  starting material for synthesis should be proposed and its choice justified by the
  applicant. The starting material for synthesis defines the starting point in the
  manufacturing process for an API to be described in an application. The applicant
  should propose and justify which substances should be considered as starting
  materials for synthesis (see section 3.2.S.2.3 for further guidance). In the case
  where the precursor to the API is obtained by fermentation, or is of plant or animal
  origin, such a molecule can be considered the API starting material regardless of
  complexity.
  A one-step synthesis may be accepted in exceptional cases, for example, where the
  API starting material is covered by a CEP, or where the API starting material is an
  API accepted through the APIMF or API prequalification procedure within the WHO
  Prequalification of Medicines Programmed, or when the structure of the API is so
  simple that a one-step synthesis can be justified, e.g. ethambutol or ethionamide.
  In addition to the detailed description of the manufacturing process as per ICH M4Q,
  the recovery of materials, if any, should be described in detail with the step in which
  they are introduced into the process. Recovery operations should be adequately
  Page 31
  controlled such that impurity levels do not increase over time. For recovery of
  solvents, any processing to improve the quality of the recovered solvent should be
  described. Regarding recycling of filtrates (mother liquors) to obtain second crops,
  information should be available on maximum holding times of mother liquors and
  maximum number of times the material can be recycled. Data on impurity levels
  should be provided to justify recycling of filtrates.
  Where there are multiple manufacturing sites being used by one API manufacturer,
  a comprehensive list in tabular form should be provided comparing the processes at
  each of the sites and highlighting any differences.
  All solvents used in the manufacture (including purification and/or crystallization
  step(s)) should be clearly identified. Solvents used in the final steps should be of
  high purity. Use of recovered solvents in the final steps of purification and/or
  crystallization is not recommended; however, their use can be justified on
  presentation of sufficient data demonstrating that recovered solvents meet
  appropriate standards as outlined in ICH Q7.
  Where polymorphic or amorphous forms have been identified, the form resulting
  from the synthesis should be stated.
  Where particle size is considered a critical attribute (see 3.2.S.3.1 for details) the
  particle size reduction method(s) (e.g. milling or micronization) should be described.
  Justification should be provided for use of alternative manufacturing processes.
  Alternative processes should be explained with the same level of detail as for the
  primary process. It should be demonstrated that batches obtained by the alternative
  processes have the same impurity profile as obtained by the principal process. If the
  Page 32
  impurity profile obtained is different it should be demonstrated to be acceptable
  according to the requirements described under S.3.2.
  It is acceptable to provide information on pilot-scale manufacture, provided it is
  representative of production scale and scale-up is reported immediately to NAFDAC
  according to the requirements of the NAFDAC variation guidelines.
  3.2. S.2.3 Control of materials (name, manufacturer)
  Materials used in the manufacture of the API (e.g. raw materials, starting
  materials, solvents, reagents, catalysts) should be listed identifying where
  each material is used in the process. Information on the quality and
  control of these materials should be provided. Information demonstrating
  that materials meet standards appropriate for their intended use should
  be provided, as appropriate (details in 3.2.A.2).
  Where the APIMF procedure is used, a cross-reference to the Restricted part of the
  APIMF is considered sufficient for this section.
  The following requirements apply to the fourth option for submission of API
  information, where full details are provided in the dossier.
  The API starting material should be fully characterized and suitable specifications
  proposed and justified, including, at a minimum, control for identity, assay, impurity
  content and any other critical attribute of the material. For each API starting material,
  the name and address of the manufacturing site(s) of the manufacturer(s) should
  be indicated. A brief description of the preparation of the API starting material should
  be provided for each manufacturer, including the solvents, catalysts and reagents
  used. A single set of specifications should be proposed for the starting material that
  Page 33
  applies to material from all sources. Any future changes to the API starting material
  manufacturers, mode of preparation or specifications should be notified.
  As indicated in section 3.2.S.2 there are occasions where a starting material for
  synthesis may also need to be defined. In general, the starting material for synthesis
  described in the PD should:
  a) be a synthetic precursor of one or more synthesis steps prior to the final API
  intermediate. Acids, bases, salts, esters and similar derivatives of the API, as
  well as the race mate of a single enantiomer API, are not considered final
  intermediates.
  b) be a well characterized, isolated and purified substance with its structure fully
  elucidated including its stereochemistry (when applicable);
  c) have well-defined specifications that include among others one or more
  specific identity tests and tests and limits for assay and specified, unspecified
  and total impurities;
  d) be incorporated as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the
  API.
  Copies of the specifications for the materials used in the synthesis, extraction, isolation and
  purification steps should be provided in the PD, including starting materials, reagents,
  solvents, catalysts and recovered materials. Confirmation should be provided that the
  specifications apply to materials used at each manufacturing site. A certificate of analysis
  of the starting material for synthesis should be provided. A summary of the information on
  starting materials should be provided in the QOS-PD.
  The carry-over of impurities of the starting materials for synthesis into the final API should
  be considered and discussed.
  Page 34
  A letter of attestation should be provided confirming that the API and the starting materials
  and reagents used to manufacture the API are without risk of transmitting agents of animal
  spongiform encephalopathies.
  When available a CEP demonstrating compliance with recommendations on transmissible
  spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) should be provided. A complete copy of the CEP
  (including any annexes) should be provided in Module 1.
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A.
  3.2. S.2.4 Controls of critical steps and intermediates (name, manufacturer)
  Critical steps: Tests and acceptance criteria (with justification including
  experimental data) performed at critical steps identified in 3.2.S.2.2 of the
  manufacturing process to ensure that the process is controlled should be
  provided.
  Intermediates: Information on the quality and control of intermediates isolated
  during the process should be provided.
  Where the APIMF procedure is used, a cross-reference to the Restricted part of the APIMF
  is considered sufficient for this section of the PD, with the exception of information that is
  also relevant for the applicant.
  The following requirements apply to the fourth option for submission of API information
  where full details are provided in the dossier.
  The critical steps should be identified. These can include: steps where significant impurities
  are removed or introduced; steps introducing an essential molecular structural element such
  as a chiral center or resulting in a major chemical transformation; steps having an impact
  on solid-state properties and homogeneity of the API that may be relevant for use in solid
  dosage forms.
  Page 35
  Specifications for isolated intermediates should be provided and should include tests and
  acceptance criteria for identity, purity and assay, where applicable.
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A.
  3.2. S.2.5 Process validation and/or evaluation (name, manufacturer)
  Process validation and/or evaluation studies for aseptic processing and
  sterilization should be included.
  Where the APIMF procedure is used, a cross-reference to the Restricted part of the
  APIMF is considered sufficient for this section of the PD.
  The following requirements apply to the fourth option for submission of API
  information where full details are provided in the dossier.
  It is expected that the manufacturing processes for all APIs are properly controlled.
  If the API is prepared as sterile a complete description should be provided of the
  aseptic processing and/or sterilization methods. A description of the controls used to
  maintain the sterility of the API during storage and transportation should also be
  provided. Alternative processes should be justified and described (see guidance in
  3.2.S.2.2 for the level of detail expected).
  3.2. S.2.6 Manufacturing process development (name, manufacturer)
  A description and discussion should be provided of the significant changes
  made to the manufacturing process and/or manufacturing site of the API
  used in producing comparative bioavailability or biowaiver, scale-up, pilot,
  and, if available, production scale batches.
  Reference should be made to the API data provided in Section 3.2. S.4.4.
  Page 36
  Where the APIMF procedure is used, a cross-reference to the Restricted part of the
  APIMF is considered sufficient for this section of the PD.
  3.2. S.3 Characterization (name, manufacturer)
  3.2. S.3.1 Elucidation of structure and other characteristics (name,
  manufacturer)
  Confirmation of structure based on, e.g. synthetic route and spectral analyses
  should be provided. Information such as the potential for isomerism, the
  identification of stereochemistry, or the potential for forming polymorphs
  should also be included.
  Elucidation of structure
  The PD should include quality assurance (QA) certified copies of the spectra, peak
  assignments and a detailed interpretation of the data from the studies performed to
  elucidate and/or confirm the structure of the API. The QOS-PD should include a list of the
  studies performed and a conclusion from the studies (e.g. whether the results support the
  proposed structure).
  For APIs that are not described in an officially recognized pharmacopoeia, the studies
  carried out to elucidate and/or confirm the chemical structure normally include elemental
  analysis, infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass
  spectra (MS) studies. Other tests could include X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and
  differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
  For APIs that are described in an officially recognized pharmacopoeia it is generally
  sufficient to provide copies of the IR spectrum of the API from each of the proposed
  manufacturer(s) run concomitantly with an officially recognized pharmacopoeia reference
  standard. See section 3.2.S.5 for details on acceptable reference standards or materials.

  Isomerism/stereochemistry
  When an API is chiral, it should be specified whether specific stereoisomers or a
  mixture of stereoisomers have been used in the comparative biostudies, and
  information should be given as to the stereoisomer of the API that is to be used
  in the FPP.
  Where the potential for stereoisomerism exists, a discussion should be included of the
  possible isomers that can result from the manufacturing process and the steps where
  chirality was introduced. The identically of the isomeric composition of the API to that of
  the API in the comparator product should be established. Information on the physical and
  chemical properties of the isomeric mixture or single enantiomer should be provided, as
  appropriate. The API specification should include a test to ensure isomeric identity and
  purity.
  The potential for interconversion of the isomers in the isomeric mixture, or racemization of
  the single enantiomer should be discussed.
  When a single enantiomer of the API is claimed for non-pharmacopoeia APIs, unequivocal
  proof of absolute configuration of asymmetric centers should be provided, such as
  determined by X-ray of a single crystal.
  If, based on the structure of the API, there is not a potential for stereoisomerism, it is
  sufficient to include a statement to this effect.
  Page 38
  Polymorphism
  Many APIs can exist in different physical forms in the solid state. Polymorphism is
  characterized as the ability of an API to exist as two or more crystalline phases that have
  different arrangements and/or conformations of the molecules in the crystal lattice.
  Amorphous solids consist of disordered arrangements of molecules and do not possess a
  distinguishable crystal lattice. Solvates are crystal forms containing either stoichiometric or
  nonstoichiometric amounts of a solvent. If the incorporated solvent is water the solvates
  are also commonly known as hydrates.
  Polymorphic forms of the same chemical compound differ in internal solid-state structure
  and, therefore, may possess different chemical and physical properties, including packing,
  thermodynamic, spectroscopic, kinetic, interfacial, and mechanical properties. These
  properties can have a direct impact on API processability, pharmaceutical product
  manufacturability and product quality and performance, including stability, dissolution and
  bioavailability. The unexpected appearance or disappearance of a polymorphic form may
  lead to serious pharmaceutical consequences.
  Applicants intending to register products with NAFDAC, and API manufacturers are expected
  to have adequate knowledge about the polymorphism of the APIs used and/or produced.
  Information on polymorphism can come from the scientific literature, patents, compendia
  or other references to determine if polymorphism is a concern, e.g. for APIs that are not
  BCS highly soluble. In the absence of published data for APIs that are not BSC highly
  soluble, polymorphic screening will be necessary to determine if the API can exist in more
  than one crystalline form. Polymorphic screening is generally accomplished via
  crystallization studies using different solvents and conditions.
  Several methods can be used to characterize the polymorphic forms of an API.
  Demonstration of a non-equivalent structure by single crystal X-ray diffraction is currently
  regarded as the definitive evidence of polymorphism. XRPD can also be used to provide
  Page 39
  unequivocal proof of polymorphism. Other methods, including microscopy, thermal analysis
  (e.g. DSC, thermal gravimetric analysis and hot-stage microscopy) and spectroscopy (e.g.
  IR, Raman, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR)) are helpful for further
  characterization of polymorphic forms. Where polymorphism is a concern, the applicants or
  manufacturers of APIs should demonstrate that a suitable method, capable of distinguishing
  different polymorphs, is available to them.
  Decision tree 4 of ICH Q6A can be used where screening is necessary and 4(2) can be used
  to investigate if different polymorphic forms have different properties that may affect
  performance, bioavailability and stability of the FPP and to decide whether a preferred
  polymorph should be monitored at release and on storage of the API. Where there is a
  preferred polymorph, acceptance criteria should be incorporated into the API specification
  to ensure polymorphic equivalence of the commercial material and that of the API batches
  used in the comparative bioavailability or biowaiver studies. The polymorphic
  characterization of the API batches used in comparative bioavailability or biowaiver studies
  by the above-mentioned methods should be provided. The method used to control
  polymorphic form should be demonstrated to be specific for the preferred form.
  Polymorphism can also include solvation or hydration products (also known as pseudo
  polymorphs). If the API is used in a solvated form, the following information should be
  provided:
  ■ Specifications for the solvent-free API in 3.2.S.2.4, if that compound is a
  synthetic precursor;
  ■ Specifications for the solvated API including appropriate limits on the weight
  ratio of API to solvent (with data to support the proposed limits); ■ a description
  of the method used to prepare the solvate in 3.2. S.2.2.
  Particle size distribution
  For APIs that are not BCS highly soluble contained in solid FPPs, or liquid FPPs containing
  undissolved API, the particle size distribution of the material can have an effect on the in
  Page 40
  vitro and/or in vivo behaviour of the FPP. Particle size distribution can also be important in
  dosage form performance (e.g. delivery of inhalation products), achieving uniformity of
  content in low-dose tablets (e.g. 2 mg or less), desired smoothness in ophthalmic
  preparations and stability of suspensions.
  If particle size distribution is an important parameter (e.g. as in the above cases), results
  from an investigation of several batches of the API should be provided, including
  characterization of the batch (es) used in the comparative bioavailability or biowaiver
  studies. API specifications should include controls on the particle size distribution to ensure
  consistency with the material in the batch (es) used in the comparative bioavailability and
  biowaiver studies (e.g. limits for d10, d50 and d90). The criteria should be established
  statistically, based on the standard deviation of the test results from the previously
  mentioned studies. The following example is provided for illustrative purposes as possible
  acceptance criteria for particle size distribution limits:
  ▪ d10 not more than (NMT) 10% of total volume less than X μm;
  ▪ d50 XX μm–XXX μm;
  ▪ D90 not less than (NLT) 90% of total volume less than XXXX μm.
  Other controls on particle size distribution can be considered acceptable, if scientifically
  justified.
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A.
  3.2. S.3.2 Impurities (name, manufacturer)
  Information on impurities should be provided.
  Details on the principles for the control of impurities (e.g. reporting, identification
  and qualification) are outlined in the ICH Q3A, Q3B and Q3C impurity guidelines (10–
  Page 41
  12). Additional information elaborating on some of the elements discussed in the
  ICH guidelines is outlined below.
  Regardless of whether a pharmacopoeia standard is claimed, a discussion should be
  provided of the potential and actual impurities arising from the synthesis,
  manufacture or degradation of the API. This should cover starting materials, by-
  products, intermediates, chiral impurities and degradation products and should
  include the chemical names, structures and origins of the impurities. The discussion
  of pharmacopoeia APIs should not be limited to the impurities specified in the API
  monograph.
  The tables in the QOS-PD template should be used to summarize the information on
  the API-related and process-related impurities. In the QOSPD, the term “origin”
  refers to how and where the impurity was introduced (e.g. “Synthetic intermediate
  from Step 4 of the synthesis” or “Potential by-product due to rearrangement from
  Step 6 of the synthesis”). It should also be indicated if the impurity is a metabolite
  of the API.
  The ICH thresholds for reporting, identification (used to set the limit for individual
  unknown impurities) and qualification are determined on the basis of potential
  exposure to the impurity, e.g. by the maximum daily dose (MDD) of the API. For
  APIs available in multiple dosage forms and strengths having different MDD values,
  it is imperative that the thresholds and corresponding controls for each of the
  presentations be considered to ensure that the risks posed by impurities have been
  addressed. This is normally achieved by using the highest potential daily MDD, rather
  than the maintenance dose. For parenteral products the maximum hourly dose of
  the API should also be included.
  It is acknowledged that APIs of semi-synthetic origin do not fall within the scope of
  the ICH impurity guidelines. However, depending on the nature of the API and the
  Page 42
  extent of the chemical modification steps, the principles regarding the control of
  impurities (e.g. reporting, identification and qualification) could be extended to apply
  to APIs of semi-synthetic origin. As an illustrative example, an API whose precursor
  molecule was derived from a fermentation process or a natural product of plant or
  animal origin, which has subsequently undergone several chemical modification
  reactions, would generally fall within the scope of the ICH impurity guidelines,
  whereas an API whose sole chemical step was the formation of a salt from a
  fermentation product generally would not. It is understood that there is some latitude
  for these types of APIs.
  Identification of impurities
  It is recognized by the pharmacopoeias that APIs can be obtained from various sources and
  thus can contain impurities not considered during the development of the monograph.
  Furthermore, a change in the production or source may give rise to additional impurities
  that are not adequately controlled by the official compendia monograph. As a result, each
  PD is assessed independently to consider the potential impurities that may arise from the
  proposed route(s) of synthesis. For these reasons the ICH limits for unspecified impurities
  (e.g. NMT 0.10% or 1.0 mg per day intake (whichever is lower) for APIs having an MDD ≤
  2 g/day) are generally recommended, rather than the general limits for unspecified
  impurities that may appear in the official compendia monograph, which could potentially be
  higher than the applicable ICH limit.
  Qualification of impurities
  The ICH impurity guidelines should be consulted for options on the qualification of
  impurities. The limit specified for an identified impurity in an officially recognized
  pharmacopoeia is generally considered to be qualified. The following is an additional option
  for qualification of impurities in existing APIs:
  Page 43
  The limit for an impurity present in an existing API can be accepted by comparing the results
  of tests for impurities found in the existing API with those observed in an innovator product
  using the same validated, stability-indicating analytical procedure (e.g. comparative (high-
  performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) studies). If samples of the innovator product
  are not available, the impurity profile may also be compared to a different prequalified FPP
  with the same route of administration and similar characteristics (e.g. tablet versus
  capsule). It is recommended that the studies be conducted on comparable samples (e.g.
  samples of a similar age) to obtain a meaningful comparison of the impurity profiles.
  Levels of impurities generated from studies under accelerated or stressed storage conditions
  of the innovator or prequalified FPP are not considered acceptable/qualified.
  A specified impurity present in the existing API is considered qualified if the amount of the
  impurity in the existing API reflects the levels observed in the innovator or prequalified FPP.
  Basis for setting the acceptance criteria
  The basis for setting the acceptance criteria for the impurities should be provided. This is
  established by considering the identification and qualification thresholds for API-related
  impurities (e.g. starting materials, by-products, intermediates, chiral impurities or
  degradation products) and the concentration limits for process-related impurities (e.g.
  residual solvents) according to the applicable ICH guidelines (e.g. Q3A, Q3C).
  The qualified level should be considered as the maximum allowable limit. However, limits
  which are considerably wider than the actual manufacturing process capability are generally
  discouraged. For this reason, the acceptance criteria are also set taking into consideration
  the actual levels of impurities found in several batches of the API from each manufacturer,
  including the levels found in the batches used for the comparative bioavailability or
  biowaiver studies. When reporting the results of quantitative tests, the actual numerical
  results should be provided rather than vague statements such as “within limits” or
  Page 44
  “conforms”. In cases where a large number of batches have been tested it is acceptable to
  summarize the results of all the batches tested with a range of analytical results.
  If there are identified impurities specified in an official compendia monograph that are not
  controlled by the proposed routine in-house analytical procedure, a justification for their
  exclusion from routine analyses should be provided (e.g. “Impurities D, E and F listed in
  The International Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Int.) Monograph are not potential impurities from the
  proposed route of synthesis used by manufacturer X”). If acceptable justification cannot be
  provided it should be demonstrated that the routine in-house method is capable of
  separating and detecting the impurities specified in the official compendia monograph at an
  acceptable level (e.g. 0.10%). If such a demonstration cannot be performed, a one-time
  study should be conducted applying the pharmacopoeia method to several recent batches
  to demonstrate the absence of the impurities listed in the pharmacopoeia.
  ICH class II solvent(s) used prior to the last step of the manufacturing process may be
  exempted from routine control in API specifications if suitable justification is provided.
  Submission of results demonstrating less than 10% of the ICH Q3C limit (option I) of the
  solvent(s) in three consecutive production-scale batches or six consecutive pilot-scale
  batches of the API or a suitable intermediate would be considered acceptable justification.
  The last step solvents used in the process should always be routinely controlled in the final
  API.
  For guidance on acceptable residual solvent limits refer to ICH Q3C. The limit for residues
  of trimethylamine (TEA) is either 320 ppm on the basis of ICH Q3C option I or 3.2 mg/day
  on the basis of permitted daily exposure (PDE).
  The absence of known, established highly toxic impurities (genotoxic) used in the process
  or formed as a by-product should be discussed and suitable limits should be proposed. The
  limits should be justified by appropriate reference to available guidance (e.g.
  Page 45
  EMEA/CHMP/QWP/ 251344/2006 (13) or USFDA Guidance for Industry. Genotoxic and
  carcinogenic impurities in drug substances and products, recommended approaches) or by
  providing experimental safety data or published data in peer-reviewed journals.
  Residues of metal catalysts used in the manufacturing process and determined to be present
  in batches of API are to be controlled in specifications. This requirement does not apply to
  metals that are deliberate components of the pharmaceutical substance (such as a counter
  ion of a salt) or metals that are used as a pharmaceutical excipient in the FPP (e.g. an iron
  oxide pigment). The guideline on the specification limits for residues of metal catalysts or
  metal reagents (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4446/2000) or any equivalent approaches can be used
  to address this issue. The requirement normally does not apply to extraneous metal
  contaminants that are more appropriately addressed by GMP, good distribution practices
  (GDP) or any other relevant quality provision such as the heavy metal test in monographs
  of recognized pharmacopoeias that cover metal contamination originating from
  manufacturing equipment and the environment.
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A, Q3A, Q3C.
  3.2. S.4 Control of the API (name, manufacturer)
  3.2. S.4.1 Specification (name, manufacturer)
  The specification for the API should be provided.
  As defined in ICH’s Q6A guideline (6), a specification is:
  ‘‘A list of tests, references to analytical procedures and appropriate acceptance
  criteria, which are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests
  described. It establishes the set of criteria to which an API or FPP should
  conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. ‘Conformance to
  specifications’ means that the API and/or FPP, when tested according to the
  listed analytical procedures, will meet the listed acceptance criteria.
  Page 46
  Specifications are critical quality standards that are proposed and justified by
  the manufacturer and approved by regulatory authorities.’’
  Copies of the API specifications, dated and signed by authorized personnel (e.g. the person
  in charge of the quality control or quality assurance department) should be provided in the
  PD, including specifications from each API manufacturer as well as those of the FPP
  manufacturer.
  The FPP manufacturer’s API specification should be summarized according to the table in
  the QOS-PD template under the headings: tests, acceptance criteria and analytical
  procedures (including types, sources and versions for the methods).
  ▪ The standard declared by the applicant could be an officially recognized compendia
  standard (e.g. BP, JP, Ph.Eur. Ph.Int., USP) or an in-house (manufacturer’s)
  standard.
  ▪ The specification reference number and version (e.g. revision number and/or date)
  should be provided for version control purposes.
  ▪ For the analytical procedures, the type should indicate the kind of analytical
  procedure used (e.g. visual, IR, UV, HPLC or laser diffraction), the source refers to
  the origin of the analytical procedure (e.g. BP, JP, and Ph.Eur. Ph.Int., USP or in-
  house) and the version (e.g. code number/version/date) should be provided for
  version control purposes.
  In cases where there is more than one API manufacturer, the FPP manufacturer’s API
  specifications should be one single compiled set of specifications that is identical for each
  manufacturer. It is acceptable to lay down in the specification more than one acceptance
  criterion and/or analytical method for a single parameter with the statement “for API from
  manufacturer A” (e.g. in the case of residual solvents).
  Any non-routine testing should be clearly identified as such and justified together with the
  proposal on the frequency of non-routine testing.
  Page 47
  The ICH Q6A guideline (6) outlines recommendations for a number of universal and specific
  tests and criteria for APIs.
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A, Q3A, Q3C and officially recognized pharmacopoeias.
  3.2. S.4.2 Analytical procedures (name, manufacturer)
  The analytical procedures used for testing the API should be provided.
  Copies of the in-house analytical procedures used to generate testing results
  provided in the PD, as well as those proposed for routine testing of the API by the
  FPP manufacturer, should be provided. Unless modified it is not necessary to provide
  copies of officially recognized compendia analytical procedures.
  Tables for summarizing a number of the different analytical procedures and
  validation information (e.g. HPLC assay/impurity methods, gas chromatography (GC)
  methods) can be found in the 2.3.R Regional information section of the QOS-PD (i.e.
  2.3.R.2). These tables should be used to summarize the in-house analytical
  procedures of the FPP manufacturer for determination of the residual solvents, assay
  and purity of the API, in section 2.3.S.4.2 of the QOS-PD. Other methods used to
  generate assay and purity data in the PD can be summarized in 2.3.S.4.4 (c) or
  2.3.S.7.3 (b) of the QOS-PD. Officially recognized compendia methods need not be
  summarized unless modifications have been made.
  Although HPLC is normally considered the method of choice for determining API-
  related impurities, other chromatographic methods such as GC and thin-layer
  chromatography (TLC) can also be used if appropriately validated. For determination
  of related substances, reference standards should normally be available for each of
  the identified impurities, particularly those known to be toxic and the concentration
  of the impurities should be quantified against their own reference standards.
  Page 48
  Impurity standards may be obtained from pharmacopoeias (individual impurities or
  resolution mixtures), from commercial sources or prepared in-house. It is considered
  acceptable to use the API as an external standard to estimate the levels of impurities,
  provided the response factors of those impurities are sufficiently close to that of the
  API, i.e. between 80 and 120%. In cases where the response factor is outside this
  range it may still be acceptable to use the API, provided a correction factor is applied.
  Data to support calculation of the correction factor should be provided for an in-
  house method. Unspecified impurities may be quantified using a solution of the API
  as the reference standard at a concentration corresponding to the limit established
  for individual unspecified impurities (e.g. 0.10%). The test for related substances in
  the Ph.Int. Monograph for lamivudine serves as a typical example.
  The system suitability tests (SSTs) represent an integral part of the method and are
  used to ensure the satisfactory performance of the chosen chromatographic system.
  As a minimum, HPLC and GC purity methods should include SSTs for resolution and
  repeatability. For HPLC methods to control API-related impurities, this is typically
  done using a solution of the API with a concentration corresponding to the limit for
  unspecified impurities. Resolution of the two closest eluting peaks is generally
  recommended. However, the choice of alternative peaks can be used if justified (e.g.
  choice of a toxic impurity). In accordance with the Ph.Int. Section on Methods of
  analysis the repeatability test should include an acceptable number of replicate
  injections. HPLC assay methods should include SSTs for repeatability and in addition
  either peak asymmetry, theoretical plates or resolution. For TLC methods, the SSTs
  should verify the ability of the system to separate and detect the analyte(s) (e.g. by
  applying a spot corresponding to the API at a concentration corresponding to the
  limit of unspecified impurities).

  Page 49
  3.2. S.4.3 Validation of analytical procedures (name, manufacturer)
  Analytical validation information, including experimental data for the
  analytical procedures used for testing the API, should be provided.
  Copies should be provided of the validation reports for the analytical procedures
  used to generate testing results provided in the PD, as well as those proposed for
  routine testing of the API by the FPP manufacturer.
  Tables for summarizing a number of the different analytical procedures and the
  validation information (e.g. HPLC assay and impurity methods, GC methods) can be
  found in the 2.3.R Regional information section of the QOS-PD (i.e. 2.3.R.2). These
  tables should be used to summarize the validation information of the analytical
  procedures of the FPP manufacturer for determination of residual solvents, assay
  and purity of the API, in section 2.3.S.4.3 of the QOS-PD. The validation data for
  other methods used to generate assay and purity data in the PD can be summarized
  in 2.3.S.4.4 (c) or 2.3.S.7.3 (b) of the QOS-PD.
  As recognized by regulatory authorities and pharmacopoeias themselves, verification
  of compendia methods can be necessary. The compendia methods as published are
  typically validated based on an API or an FPP originating from a specific
  manufacturer. Different sources of the same API or FPP can contain impurities and/or
  degradation products that were not considered during the development of the
  monograph. Therefore, the monograph and compendia method should be
  demonstrated as suitable to control the impurity profile of the API from the intended
  source(s).
  In general verification is not necessary for compendia API assay methods. However,
  specificity of a specific compendia assay method should be demonstrated if there
  are any potential impurities that are not specified in the compendia monograph. If
  an officially recognized compendia method is used to control API-related impurities
  Page 50
  that are not specified in the monograph, full validation of the method is expected
  with respect to those impurities.
  If an officially recognized compendia standard is claimed and an in-house method is
  used in lieu of the compendia method (e.g. for assay or for specified impurities),
  equivalence of the in-house and compendia methods should be demonstrated. This
  could be accomplished by performing duplicate analyses of one sample by both
  methods and providing the results from the study. For impurity methods the sample
  analyzed should be the API spiked with impurities at concentrations equivalent to
  their specification limits.
  Reference documents: ICH Q2.
  3.2. S.4.4 Batch analyses (name, manufacturer)
  Description of batches and results of batch analyses should be provided.
  The information provided should include batch number, batch size, date and
  production site of relevant API batches used in comparative bioavailability or
  biowaiver studies, preclinical and clinical data (if relevant), stability, pilot, scale up
  and, if available, production-scale batches. These data are used to establish the
  specifications and evaluate consistency in API quality.
  Analytical results should be provided from at least two batches of at least pilot scale
  from each proposed manufacturing site of the API and should include the batch(es)
  used in the comparative bioavailability or biowaiver studies. A pilot-scale batch
  should be manufactured by a procedure fully representative of and simulating that
  to be applied to a full production-scale batch.
  Page 51
  Copies of the certificates of analysis, both from the API manufacturer(s) and the FPP
  manufacturer, should be provided for the profiled batches and any company
  responsible for generating the test results should be identified. The FPP
  manufacturer’s test results should be summarized in the QOS-PD.
  The discussion of results should focus on observations noted for the various tests,
  rather than reporting comments such as “all tests meet specifications”. For
  quantitative tests (e.g. individual and total impurity tests and assay tests), it should
  be ensured that actual numerical results are provided rather than vague statements
  such as “within limits” or “conforms”.
  A discussion and justification should be provided for any incomplete analyses (e.g.
  results not tested according to the proposed specification).
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A, Q3A, Q3C).
  3.2. S.4.5 Justification of specification (name, manufacturer)
  Justification for the API specification should be provided.
  A discussion should be provided on the inclusion of certain tests, evolution of tests,
  analytical procedures and acceptance criteria, and differences from the officially
  recognized compendia standard(s). If the officially recognized compendia methods
  have been modified or replaced a discussion of the modifications or replacement
  method(s) should be included.
  The justification for certain tests, analytical procedures and acceptance criteria may
  have been discussed in other sections of the PD (e.g. for impurities or particle size
  distribution) and does not need to be repeated here, although a cross-reference
  should be provided.
  Page 52
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A, Q3A, Q3C, and officially recognized
  pharmacopoeias.
  3.2. S.5 Reference standards or materials (name, manufacturer)
  Information on the reference standards or reference materials used for
  testing of the API should be provided.
  Information should be provided on the reference standard(s) used to generate data
  in the PD, as well as those to be used by the FPP manufacturer in routine API and
  FPP testing.
  The source(s) of the reference standards or materials used in the testing of the API
  should be provided (e.g. those used for the identification, purity and assay tests).
  These could be classified as primary or secondary reference standards.
  A suitable primary reference standard should be obtained from an officially
  recognized pharmacopoeia source (e.g. BP, JP, and Ph.Eur. Ph.Int., USP) where one
  exists, and the lot number should be provided. Where a pharmacopoeia standard is
  claimed for the API and/or the FPP, the primary reference standard should be
  obtained from that pharmacopoeia when available. Primary reference standards from
  officially recognized pharmacopoeia sources do not need further structural
  elucidation.
  Otherwise, a primary standard may be a batch of the API that has been fully
  characterized (e.g. by IR, UV, NMR and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses). Further
  purification techniques may be needed to render the material acceptable for use as
  a chemical reference standard. The purity requirements for a chemical reference
  substance depend upon its intended use. A chemical reference substance proposed
  for an identification test does not require meticulous purification since the presence
  Page 53
  of a small percentage of impurities in the substance often has no noticeable effect
  on the test. On the other hand, chemical reference substances that are to be used
  in assays should possess a high degree of purity (such as 99.5% on the dried or
  water/solvent free basis). Absolute content of the primary reference standard must
  be declared and should follow the scheme: 100% minus organic impurities
  (quantified by an assay procedure, e.g. HPLC or DSC) minus inorganic impurities
  minus volatile impurities by loss on drying (or water content minus residual solvents).
  A secondary (or in-house) reference standard can be used by establishing it against
  a suitable primary reference standard, e.g. by providing legible copies of the IR of
  the primary and secondary reference standards run concomitantly and by providing
  its certificate of analysis, including assay determined against the primary reference
  standard. A secondary reference standard is often characterized and evaluated for
  its intended purpose with additional procedures other than those used in routine
  testing (e.g. if additional solvents are used during the additional purification process
  that are not used for routine purposes).
  Reference standards should normally be established for specified impurities. Refer
  to 3.2.S.4.2 for additional guidance.
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A, WHO Technical Report Series, No. 943, Annex 3.
  3.2. S.6 Container-closure system (name, manufacturer)
  A description of the container-closure system(s) should be provided,
  including the identity of materials of construction of each primary
  packaging component, and their specifications. The specifications should
  include description and identification (and critical dimensions with
  drawings, where appropriate). Non-compendia methods (with validation)
  should be included, where appropriate.
  Page 54
  For non-functional secondary packaging components (e.g. those that do
  not provide additional protection), only a brief description should be
  provided. For functional secondary packaging components, additional
  information should be provided.
  The suitability should be discussed with respect to, for example, choice of
  materials, protection from moisture and light, compatibility of the
  materials of construction with the API, including sorption to container and
  leaching, and/or safety of materials of construction.
  The WHO Guidelines on packaging for pharmaceutical products and the officially
  recognized pharmacopoeias should be consulted for recommendations on the
  packaging information for APIs.
  Primary packaging components are those that are in direct contact with the API or
  FPP. The specifications for the primary packaging components should be provided
  and should include a specific test for identification (e.g. IR).
  Copies of the labels applied on the secondary packaging of the API should be
  provided and should include the conditions of storage. In addition, the name and
  address of the manufacturer of the API should be stated on the container, regardless
  of whether relabeling is conducted at any stage during the API distribution process.
  3.2. S.7 Stability (name, manufacturer)
  3.2. S.7.1 Stability summary and conclusions (name, manufacturer)
  The types of studies conducted, protocols used, and the results of the
  studies should be summarized. The summary should include results, for
  example, from forced degradation studies and stress conditions, as well
  Page 55
  as conclusions with respect to storage conditions and retest date or shelf-
  life, as appropriate.
  The WHO guidelines Stability testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and
  finished pharmaceutical products should be consulted for recommendations on the
  core stability data package required for the prequalification of APIs and FPPs.
  As outlined in the WHO stability guidelines, the purpose of stability testing is to:
  “provide evidence of how the quality of an API or FPP varies with time under the
  influence of a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and
  light.”
  The tables in the QOS-PD template should be used to summarize the results from
  the stability studies and related information (e.g. conditions, testing parameters,
  conclusions and commitments).
  Stress testing
  As outlined in the ICH Q1A guidance document, stress testing of the API can help identify
  the likely degradation products which, in turn, can help to establish the degradation
  pathways and the intrinsic stability of the molecule and validate the stability-indicating
  power of the analytical procedures used. The nature of the stress testing will depend on
  the individual API and the type of FPP involved.
  Stress testing may be carried out on a single batch of the API. For examples of typical stress
  conditions refer to section 2.1.2 of WHO Technical Report Series, No. 953, Annex 2, as well
  as “A typical set of studies of the degradation paths of an active pharmaceutical ingredient”,
  in: WHO Technical Report Series, No. 929, Annex 5, Table A1.
  The objective of stress testing is not to completely degrade the API but to cause degradation
  to occur to a small extent, typically 10–30% loss of API by assay when compared with non-
  Page 56
  degraded API. This target is chosen so that some degradation occurs, but not enough to
  generate secondary products. For this reason, the conditions and duration may need to be
  varied when the API is especially susceptible to a particular stress factor. In the total
  absence of degradation products after 10 days the API is considered stable under the
  particular stress condition.
  The tables in the QOS-PD template should be used to summarize the results of the stress
  testing and should include the treatment conditions (e.g. temperatures, relative humidity,
  concentrations of solutions and durations) and the observations for the various test
  parameters (e.g. assay, degradation products). The discussion of results should highlight
  whether mass balance was observed.
  Photo stability testing should be an integral part of stress testing. The standard conditions
  are described in ICH Q1B (22). If “protect from light” is stated in one of the officially
  recognized pharmacopoeias for the API, it is sufficient to state “protect from light” on
  labelling, in lieu of photo stability studies when the container-closure system is shown to be
  light protective.
  When available it is acceptable to provide the relevant data published in the scientific
  literature (including, but not limited to, WHO Public Assessment Reports (WHOPARs),
  European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs)) to support the identified degradation
  products and pathways.
  Accelerated and long-term testing
  Available information on the stability of the API under accelerated and long-term storage
  conditions should be provided, including information in the public domain or obtained from
  scientific literature. The source of the information should be identified.
  The required long-term storage conditions for APIs is 30 ºC ± 2 ºC/75% ± 5% RH. Studies
  covering the proposed retest period under the above-mentioned long-term storage
  Page 57
  conditions will provide better assurance of the stability of APIs at the conditions of the
  supply chain corresponding to the Nigerian environmental conditions (i.e. Zone IVB).
  Alternative conditions should be supported with appropriate evidence, which may include
  literature references or in-house studies, demonstrating that storage at 30 ºC is
  inappropriate for the API. For APIs intended for storage in a refrigerator and those intended
  for storage in a freezer, refer to the WHO stability guidelines in the WHO Technical Report
  Series, No. 953, Annex 2. APIs intended for storage below −20 °C should be treated on a
  case-by-case basis.
  To establish the retest period, data should be provided on not less than three batches of at
  least pilot scale. The batches should be manufactured by the same synthesis route as
  production batches and using a method of manufacture and a procedure that simulates the
  final process to be used for production batches. The stability testing programme should be
  summarized, and the results of stability testing should be summarized in the dossier and in
  the tables in the QOS-PD.
  The information on the stability studies should include details such as storage conditions,
  batch number, batch size, container-closure system and completed (and proposed) test
  intervals. The discussion of results should focus on observations noted for the various tests,
  rather than reporting comments such as “all tests meet specifications”. Ranges of analytical
  results where relevant and any trends that were observed should be included. For
  quantitative tests (e.g. individual and total degradation product tests and assay tests), it
  should be ensured that actual numerical results are provided rather than vague statements
  such as “within limits” or “conforms”. Where methods are different from those described in
  S.4.2, descriptions and validation of the methodology used in stability studies should be
  provided.
  The minimum data required at the time of submitting the dossier (in the general case) are
  shown in Table 1.

  RH, there is no intermediate condition.
  Refer to WHO Technical Report Series, No. 953, Annex 2 for further information regarding
  the storage conditions, container-closure system, test specifications and testing frequency.
  Proposed storage statement and retest period
  A storage statement should be established for display on the label, based on the stability
  evaluation of the API. The WHO stability guidelines include a number of recommended
  storage statements that should be used when supported by the stability studies.
  A retest period should be derived from the stability information and should be displayed on
  the container label.
  After this retest period a batch of API destined for use in the manufacture of an FPP could
  be retested and then, if in compliance with the specification, could be used immediately
  (e.g. within 30 days). If retested and found compliant, the batch does not receive an
  additional period corresponding to the time established for the retest period. However, an
  API batch can be retested multiple times and a different portion of the batch used after
  each retest, as long as it continues to comply with the specification. For APIs known to be
  labile (e.g. certain antibiotics) it is more appropriate to establish a shelf-life than a retest
  period.
  Page 59
  Limited extrapolation of the real-time data from the long-term storage condition beyond
  the observed range to extend the retest period can be done at the time of assessment of
  the PD, if justified. Applicants should consult the ICH Q1E guideline (23) for further details
  on the evaluation and extrapolation of results from stability data (e.g. if significant change
  was not observed within 6 months at accelerated conditions and the data show little or no
  variability, the proposed retest period could be up to twice the period covered by the long-
  term data, but should not exceed the long-term data by more than 12 months).

  Annex 2.
  3.2. S.7.2 Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment (name,
  Manufacturer)
  The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment should be
  provided.
  Primary stability study commitment
  When the available long-term stability data on primary batches do not cover the proposed
  retest period granted at the time of assessment of the PD, a commitment should be made
  to continue the stability studies in order to firmly establish the retest period. A written
  commitment (signed and dated) to continue long-term testing over the retest period should
  be included in the dossier when relevant.
  Commitment stability studies
  The long-term stability studies for the commitment batches should be conducted through
  the proposed retest period on at least three production batches. Where stability data were
  not provided for three production batches, a written commitment (signed and dated) should
  be included in the dossier.
  Page 60
  The stability protocol for the commitment batches should be provided and should include,
  but not be limited to, the following parameters:
   number of batch(es) and different batch sizes, if applicable;
   relevant physical, chemical, microbiological and biological test methods;
   acceptance criteria;
   reference to test methods;
   description of the container-closure system(s);
   testing frequency;
   description of the conditions of storage (standardized conditions for long-term testing
  as described in these guidelines and consistent with the API labelling, should be used);
   Other applicable parameters specific to the API.
  Ongoing stability studies
  The stability of the API should be monitored according to a continuous and appropriate
  programme that will permit the detection of any stability issue (e.g. changes in levels of
  degradation products). The purpose of the ongoing stability programme is to monitor the
  API and to determine that the API remains stable and can be expected to remain stable
  within the retest period in all future batches.
  At least one production batch per year of API (unless none is produced during that year)
  should be added to the stability monitoring programme and tested at least annually to
  confirm the stability. In certain situations, additional batches should be included. A written
  commitment (signed and dated) to ongoing stability studies should be included in the
  dossier.
  Refer to section 2.1.11 of WHO Technical Report Series, No. 953, Annex 2, for further
  information on ongoing stability studies.
  Any differences between the stability protocols used for the primary batches and those
  proposed for the commitment batches or ongoing batches should be scientifically justified.

  3.2. S.7.3 Stability data (name, manufacturer)
  Results of the stability studies (e.g. forced degradation studies and stress
  conditions) should be presented in an appropriate format such as tabular,
  graphical, or narrative. Information on the analytical procedures used to
  generate the data and validation of these procedures should be included.
  The actual stability results used to support the proposed retest period should be
  included in the dossier. For quantitative tests (e.g. individual and total degradation
  product tests and assay tests) it should be ensured that actual numerical results are
  provided rather than vague statements such as “within limits” or “conforms”.

  No. 953, Annex 2.
  3.2. P Drug product (or finished pharmaceutical product (FPP))
  3.2. P.1 Description and composition of the FPP (name, dosage form)
  A description of the FPP and its composition should be provided. The
  information provided should include, for example:
   Description of the dosage form
  • The description of the FPP should include the physical description, available
  strengths, release mechanism (e.g. immediate or modified (delayed or
  extended)), as well as any other distinguishable characteristics, e.g.
  • “The proposed XYZ 50-mg tablets are available as white, oval, film-coated
  tablets, debossed with ‘50’ on one side and a break-line on the other side.
  Page 62
  • The proposed XYZ 100-mg tablets are available as yellow, round, film-coated
  tablets, debossed with ‘100’ on one side and plain on the other side.”
  • ■ Composition, i.e. list of all components of the dosage form, and
  their amount on a per unit basis (including overages, if any), the
  function of the components, and a reference to their quality
  standards (e.g. compendia monographs or manufacturer’s
  specifications).
  • The tables in the QOS-PD template should be used to summarize the
  composition of the FPP and express the quantity of each component on a per
  unit basis (e.g. mg per tablet, mg per ml, mg per vial) and a percentage basis,
  including a statement of the total weight or measure of the dosage unit. The
  individual components for mixtures prepared in-house (e.g. coatings) should
  be included in the tables where applicable.
  • All components used in the manufacturing process should be listed, including
  those that may not be added to every batch (e.g. acid and alkali), those that
  may be removed during processing (e.g. solvents) and any others (e.g.
  nitrogen or silicon for stoppers). If the FPP is formulated using an active
  moiety, then the composition for the active ingredient should be clearly
  indicated (e.g. “1 mg of active ingredient base = 1.075 mg active ingredient
  hydrochloride”). All overages should be clearly indicated (e.g. “contains 2%
  overage of the API to compensate for manufacturing losses”).
  • The components should be declared by their proper or common names, quality
  standards (e.g. BP, JP, and Ph.Eur. Ph.Int., USP, in-house) and, if applicable,
  their grades (e.g. “microcrystalline cellulose NF (PH 102)”) and special
  technical characteristics (e.g. lyophilized, micronized, solubilized or
  emulsified).
  • The function of each component (e.g. diluent or filler, binder, disintegrate,
  lubricant, glidant, granulating solvent, coating agent or antimicrobial
  Page 63
  preservative) should be stated. If an excipient performs multiple functions the
  predominant function should be indicated.
  • The qualitative composition, including solvents, should be provided for all
  proprietary components or blends (e.g. capsule shells, colouring blends or
  imprinting inks). This information (excluding the solvents) is to be listed in the
  product information (e.g. summary of product characteristics, labelling and
  package leaflet).
   ■ Description of accompanying reconstitution diluent(s)
  • For FPPs supplied with reconstitution diluent(s) that are commercially available
  or that have been assessed and considered acceptable in connection with
  another product dossier with NAFDAC, a brief description of the reconstitution
  diluents(s) should be provided.
  • For FPPs supplied with reconstitution diluent(s) that are not commercially
  available or have not been assessed and considered acceptable in connection
  with another product dossier with NAFDAC, information on the diluent(s)
  should be provided in a separate FPP portion (“3.2.P”), as appropriate.
  • ■ Type of container and closure used for the dosage form and
  accompanying reconstitution diluent, if applicable
  • The container-closure used for the FPP (and accompanying reconstitution
  diluent, if applicable) should be briefly described, with further details provided
  under 3.2.P.7 Container-closure system, e.g.
   “The product is available in HDPE bottles with polypropylene
  caps (in sizes of 100s, 500s and 1000s) and in PVC/aluminum
  foil unit dose blisters (in packages of
   100s) (cards of 5 × 2, 10 cards per package).”
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A (6).
  Page 64
  3.2. P.2 Pharmaceutical development (name, dosage form)
  The Pharmaceutical development section should contain information on
  the development studies conducted to establish that the dosage form, the
  formulation, manufacturing process, container-closure system,
  microbiological attributes, and usage instructions are appropriate for the
  purpose specified in the product dossier. The studies described here are
  distinguished from routine control tests conducted according to
  specifications. Additionally, this section should identify and describe the
  formulation and process attributes (critical parameters) that can influence
  batch reproducibility, product performance and FPP quality. Supportive
  data and results from specific studies or published literature can be
  included within or attached to the Pharmaceutical development section.
  Additional supportive data can be referenced to the relevant nonclinical or
  clinical sections of the product dossier.
  Pharmaceutical development information should include, at a minimum:
   the definition of the quality target product profile (QTPP) as it relates to quality,
  safety and efficacy, considering, for example, the route of administration, dosage
  form, bioavailability, strength and stability;
   identification of the potential critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the FPP so as to
  adequately control the product characteristics that could have an impact on
  quality;
   discussion of the potential CQAs of the API(s), excipients and container-closure
  system(s) including the selection of the type, grade and amount to deliver drug
  product of the desired quality;
   discussion of the selection criteria for the manufacturing process and the control
  strategy required to manufacture commercial lots meeting the QTPP in a
  consistent manner.
  Page 65
  These features should be discussed as part of the product development using the principles
  of risk management over the entire life-cycle of the product (ICH Q8).
  For a discussion of additional pharmaceutical development issues specific to the
  development of FDCs reference should be made to section 6.3.2 of WHO Technical Report
  Series, No. 929, Annex 5 (21).
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A, Q8, Q9, Q10.
  3.2. P.2.1 Components of the FPP (name, dosage form)
  3.2. P.2.1.1 Active pharmaceutical ingredient (name, dosage form)
  The compatibility of the API with excipients listed in 3.2.P.1 should
  be discussed. Additionally, key physicochemical characteristics (e.g.
  water content, solubility, particle size distribution, polymorphic or
  solid state form) of the API that can influence the performance of the
  FPP should be discussed. For FDCs, the compatibility of APIs with
  each other should be discussed.
  Physicochemical characteristics of the API may influence both the manufacturing
  capability and the performance of the FPP.
  Guidance on compatibility studies is provided in Appendix 3 of the WHO
  Guidelines for registration of fixed-dose combination medicinal products (WHO
  Technical Report Series, No. 929, Annex 5, 2005). In addition to visual
  examination, chromatographic results (assay, purity) are required to
  demonstrate API–API and API–excipient compatibility. In general, API–
  excipient compatibility is not required to be established for specific excipients
  when evidence is provided (e.g. in the SmPC or product leaflet) that the
  excipients are present in the comparator product.
  3.2. P.2.1.2 Excipients (name, dosage form)
  Page 66
  The choice of excipients listed in 3.2.P.1, their concentration and their
  characteristics that can influence the FPP performance should be
  discussed relative to their respective functions.
  When choosing excipients those with a compendia monograph are generally
  preferred and may be required in certain jurisdictions. Other resources are
  available for information on acceptable excipients and their concentrations,
  such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inactive ingredient guide
  (IIG) list and the Handbook of pharmaceutical excipients. Use of excipients in
  concentrations outside established ranges is discouraged and generally requires
  justification. In addition, available guidelines should be referenced which
  discuss excipients to be avoided, for example azo-colourants as listed in the
  EMA Guideline CPMP/463/00. Other guidance such as the WHO Guidelines on
  development of paediatric medicines: points to consider in formulation (32) may
  provide useful general guidance in this regard.
  Ranges in concentrations or alternatives for excipients are normally not
  accepted unless supported by appropriate process validation data. Where
  relevant, compatibility study results (e.g. on compatibility of a primary or
  secondary amine API with lactose) should be included to justify the choice of
  excipients. Specific details should be provided where necessary (e.g. on use of
  potato or corn starch).
  Where antioxidants are included in the formulation, the effectiveness of the
  proposed concentration of the antioxidant should be justified and verified by
  appropriate studies.
  Antimicrobial preservatives are discussed in 3.2. P.2.5.
  3.2. P.2.2 Finished pharmaceutical product (name, dosage form)
  3.2. P.2.2.1 Formulation development (name, dosage form)
  Page 67
  A summary describing the development of the FPP should be
  provided, taking into consideration the proposed route of
  administration and usage. The differences between the comparative
  bioavailability or biowaiver formulations and the formulation (i.e.
  composition) described in 3.2.P.1 should be discussed. Results from
  comparative in vitro studies (e.g. dissolution) or comparative in vivo
  studies (e.g. bioequivalence) should be discussed, when appropriate.
  An established multisource product is one that has been marketed by the
  applicant or manufacturer associated with the dossier for at least five years and
  for which at least 10 production batches were produced over the previous year
  or, if less than 10 batches were produced in the previous year, not less than
  25 batches were produced in the previous three years. For products that meet
  the criteria of an established multisource product, all sections of P.2.2.1 of the
  dossier and QOS-PD should be completed except for P.2.2.1 (a). In addition, a
  product quality review should be provided as outlined in Appendix 2.
  The requirements for bioequivalence studies should be taken into
  consideration, for example, when formulating multiple strengths and/or when
  the product(s) may be eligible for a biowaiver. WHO reference documents (e.g.
  WHO Technical Report Series, No. 937, Annex 7) should be consulted.
  Product scoring may be recommended or required, for example, when scoring
  is specified in the listing of recommended comparator products, or when
  division into fractional doses may be necessary according to approved
  posology.
  If the proposed FPP is a functionally scored tablet a study should be undertaken
  to ensure the uniformity of dose in the tablet fragments. The data provided in
  the PD should include a description of the test method, individual values, mean
  and relative standard deviation (RSD) of the results. Uniformity testing (i.e.
  content uniformity for split portions containing less than 5 mg or less than 5%
  of the weight of the dosage unit portion, or mass uniformity for other situations)
  Page 68
  should be performed on each split portion from a minimum of 10 randomly
  selected whole tablets. As an illustrative example, the number of units (i.e. the
  splits) would be 10 halves for bisected tablets (one half of each tablet is
  retained for the test) or 10 quarters for quadrisect tablets (one quarter of each
  tablet is retained for the test). At least one batch of each strength should be
  tested. Ideally the study should cover a range of the hardness values. The
  splitting of the tablets should be performed in a manner that would be
  representative of that used by the consumer (e.g. manually split by hand). The
  uniformity test on split portions can be demonstrated on a one-time basis and
  does not need to be added to the FPP specification(s). The tablet description
  in the FPP specification and in the product information (e.g. SmPC, labelling
  and package leaflet) should reflect the presence of a score.
  If splitting of a tablet is intended for preparation of a peadiatric dose a
  demonstration of content uniformity of tablet fragments may be required.
  Where relevant, labelling should state that the score line is only to facilitate
  breaking for ease of swallowing and not to divide the tablet into equal doses.
  In vitro dissolution or drug release
  A discussion should be included as to how the development of the formulation relates
  to development of the dissolution method(s) and the generation of the dissolution
  profile.
  The results of studies justifying the choice of in vitro dissolution or drug release
  conditions (e.g. apparatus, rotation speed and medium) should be provided. Data
  should also be submitted to demonstrate whether the method is sensitive to changes
  in manufacturing processes and/or changes in grades and/or amounts of critical
  excipients and particle size where relevant. The dissolution method should be sensitive
  to any changes in the product that would result in a change in one or more of the
  pharmacokinetic parameters. Use of a single point test or a dissolution range should
  be justified based on the solubility and/ or biopharmaceutical classification of the API.
  Page 69
  For slower dissolving immediate-release products (e.g. Q = 80% in 90 minutes), a
  second time point may be warranted (e.g. Q = 60% in 45 minutes).
  Modified-release FPPs should have a meaningful in vitro release rate (dissolution) test
  that is used for routine quality control. Preferably this test should possess in vitro–in
  vivo correlation. Results demonstrating the effect of pH on the dissolution profile
  should be submitted if appropriate for the type of dosage form.
  For extended-release FPPs, the testing conditions should be set to cover the entire
  time period of expected release (e.g. at least three test intervals chosen for a 12-hour
  release and additional test intervals for longer duration of release). One of the test
  points should be at the early stage of drug release (e.g. within the first hour) to
  demonstrate absence of dose dumping. At each test point, upper and lower limits
  should be set for individual units. Generally, the acceptance range at each
  intermediate test point should not exceed 25% or ± 12.5% of the targeted value.
  Dissolution results should be submitted for several lots, including those lots used for
  pharmacokinetic and bioavailability or biowaiver studies. Recommendations for
  conducting and assessing comparative dissolution profiles can be found in Appendix

1.  3.2. P.2.2.2 Overages (name, dosage form)
    Any overages in the formulation(s) described in 3.2.P.1 should be
    justified.
    Justification of an overage to compensate for loss during manufacture should
    be provided, including information on the step(s) where the loss occurs, the
    reasons for the loss and batch analysis release data (assay results).
    Overages for the sole purpose of extending the shelf-life of the FPP are generally
    not acceptable.
    3.2. P.2.2.3 Physicochemical and biological properties (name, dosage form)
    Page 70
    Parameters relevant to the performance of the FPP, such as pH, ionic
    strength, dissolution, redispersion, reconstitution, particle size
    distribution, aggregation, polymorphism, rheological properties,
    biological activity or potency, and/or immunological activity, should
    be addressed.
    3.2. P.2.3 Manufacturing process development (name, dosage form)
    The selection and optimization of the manufacturing process described in
    3.2.P.3.3, in particular its critical aspects, should be explained. Where
    relevant, the method of sterilization should be explained and justified.
    Where relevant, justification for the selection of aseptic processing or other
    sterilization methods over terminal sterilization should be provided.
    Differences between the manufacturing processes (es) used to produce
    comparative bioavailability or biowaiver batches and the process
    described in 3.2.P.3.3 that can influence the performance of the product
    should be discussed.
    For products that meet the criteria of an established multisource product, to fulfil the
    requirements of section P.2.3, section P.2.3 (b) of the dossier and QOS-PD should
    be completed and a product quality review should be submitted as outlined in
    Appendix 2. The guidance that follows applies to all other products for which section
    P.2.3 should be completed in its entirety.
    The rationale for choosing the particular pharmaceutical product (e.g.
    Dosage form, delivery system) should be provided. The scientific rationale for the
    choice of the manufacturing, filling and packaging processes that can influence FPP
    quality and performance should be explained (e.g. wet granulation using high shear
    granulator). API stress study results may be included in the rationale. Any
    Page 71
    developmental work undertaken to protect the FPP from deterioration should also
    be included (e.g. protection from light or moisture).
    The scientific rationale for the selection, optimization and scale-up of the
    manufacturing process described in 3.2.P.3.3 should be explained, in particular the
    critical aspects (e.g. rate of addition of granulating fluid, massing time and
    granulation end-point). A discussion of the critical process parameters (CPP),
    controls and robustness with respect to the QTPP and CQA of the product should be
    included (ICH Q8).
    3.2. P.2.4 Container-closure system (name, dosage form)
    The suitability of the container-closure system (described in 3.2.P.7) used
    for the storage, transportation (shipping) and use of the FPP should be
    discussed. This discussion should consider, e.g. choice of materials,
    protection from moisture and light, compatibility of the materials of
    construction with the dosage form (including sorption to container and
    leaching) safety of materials of construction, and performance (such as
    reproducibility of the dose delivery from the device when presented as
    part of the FPP).
    Testing requirements to verify the suitability of the container-closure system contact
    material(s) depend on the dosage form and route of administration. The
    pharmacopoeias provide standards that are required for packaging materials,
    including, for example, the following:

- glass containers:
- plastic containers:
- rubber/elastomeric closures:
  Page 72
  Table 2 outlines the general recommendations for the various dosage forms for one-time
  studies to establish the suitability of the container-closure system contact materials.

  For solid oral dosage forms and solid APIs, compliance with regulations on plastic materials
  coming into contact with food (for example (EU) No. 10/2011 (40)) can be considered
  acceptable.
  The suitability of the container-closure system used for the storage, transportation
  (shipping) and use of any intermediate or in-process products (e.g. premixes or bulk FPP)
  should also be discussed.
  A device is required to be included with the container-closure system for administration of
  oral liquids or solids (e.g. solutions, emulsions, suspensions and powders or granules),
  whenever the package provides for multiple doses.
  In accordance with the Ph.Int. General chapter Liquid preparations for oral use:

  ‘‘Each dose from a multi-dose container is administered by means of a device
  suitable for measuring the prescribed volume. The device is usually a spoon or
  a cup for volumes of 5 ml or multiples thereof, or an oral syringe for other
  volumes or, for oral drops, a suitable dropper.’’
  For a device accompanying a multi-dose container, the results of a study should be provided
  demonstrating the reproducibility of the device (e.g. consistent delivery of the intended
  volume), generally at the lowest intended dose.
  A sample of the device should be provided with Module 1.
  3.2. P.2.5 Microbiological attributes (name, dosage form)
  Where appropriate, the microbiological attributes of the dosage form
  should be discussed, including, for example, the rationale for not
  performing microbial limits testing for non-sterile products and the
  selection and effectiveness of preservative systems in products containing
  antimicrobial preservatives. For sterile products, the integrity of the
  container-closure system to prevent microbial contamination should be
  addressed.
  Where an antimicrobial preservative is included in the formulation, the amount used
  should be justified by submission of results of studies on the product formulated with
  different concentrations of the preservative(s) to demonstrate the least necessary
  but still effective concentration. The effectiveness of the agent should be justified
  and verified by appropriate studies (e.g. USP or Ph.Eur. general chapters on
  antimicrobial preservatives) using a batch of the FPP. If the lower limit for the
  proposed acceptance criterion for the assay of the preservative is less than 90.0%,
  the effectiveness of the agent should be established with a batch of the FPP
  Page 75
  containing a concentration of the antimicrobial preservative corresponding to the
  lower proposed acceptance criteria.
  As outlined in the WHO stability guidelines (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 953,
  Annex 2, 2009), a single primary stability batch of the FPP should be tested for
  effectiveness of the antimicrobial preservative (in addition to preservative content)
  at the proposed shelf-life for verification purposes, regardless of whether there is a
  difference between the release and shelf-life acceptance criteria for preservative
  content.
  3.2. P.2.6 Compatibility (name, dosage form)
  The compatibility of the FPP with reconstitution diluent(s) or dosage
  devices (e.g. precipitation of API in solution, sorption on injection vessels,
  stability) should be addressed to provide appropriate and supportive
  information for the labelling.
  Where a device is required for oral liquids or solids (e.g. solutions, emulsions,
  suspensions and powders or granules for such reconstitution) that are intended to
  be administered immediately after being added to the device, the compatibility
  studies mentioned in the following paragraphs are not required.
  Where sterile, reconstituted products are to be further diluted, compatibility should
  be demonstrated with all diluents over the range of dilution proposed in the labelling.
  These studies should preferably be conducted on aged samples. Where the labelling
  does not specify the type of containers, compatibility (with respect to parameters
  such as appearance, pH, assay, levels of individual and total degradation products,
  sub visible particulate matter and extractables from the packaging components)
  should be demonstrated in glass, PVC and polyolefin containers. However, if one or
  Page 76
  more containers are identified in the labelling, compatibility of admixtures needs to
  be demonstrated only in the specified containers.
  Studies should cover the duration of storage reported in the labelling (e.g. 24 hours
  under controlled room temperature and 72 hours under refrigeration). Where the
  labelling specifies co-administration with other FPPs, compatibility should be
  demonstrated with respect to the principal FPP as well as the co-administered FPP
  (i.e. in addition to other aforementioned parameters for the mixture, the assay and
  degradation levels of each co-administered FPP should be reported).
  3.2. P.3 Manufacture (name, dosage form)
  3.2. P.3.1 Manufacturer(s) (name, dosage form)
  The name, address, and responsibility of each manufacturer, including
  contractors, and each proposed production site or facility involved in
  manufacturing and testing should be provided.
  The facilities involved in the manufacturing, packaging, labelling and testing should
  be listed. If certain companies are responsible only for specific steps (e.g.
  manufacturing of an intermediate), this should be clearly indicated (WHO good
  distribution practices for pharmaceutical products).
  The list of manufacturers or companies should specify the actual addresses of
  production or manufacturing site(s) involved (including block(s) and unit(s)), rather
  than the administrative offices.
  For a mixture of an API with an excipient, the blending of the API with the excipient
  is considered to be the first step in the manufacture of the final product and,
  therefore, the mixture does not fall under the definition of an API. The only
  exceptions are in the cases where the API cannot exist on its own. Similarly, for a
  mixture of APIs, the blending of the APIs is considered to be the first step in the
  Page 77
  manufacture of the final product. Sites for such manufacturing steps should be listed
  in this section.
  A valid manufacturing authorization for pharmaceutical production, as well as a
  marketing authorization, should be submitted to demonstrate that the product is
  registered or licensed in accordance with national requirements (Module 1, 1.2.2).
  For each site where the major production step(s) are carried out, when applicable,
  attach a WHO-type certificate of GMP issued by the competent authority in terms of
  the WHO Certification Scheme on the quality of pharmaceutical products moving in
  international commerce (Module 1, 1.2.2).
  Justification for any differences to the product in the country or countries
  issuing the WHO-type certificate(s)
  When there are differences between the product for which this application is submitted and
  that marketed in the country or countries which provided the WHO-type certificate(s), it is
  necessary to provide data to support the applicability of the certificate(s) despite the
  differences. Depending on the case, it may be necessary to provide validation data for
  example for differences in site of manufacture, specifications and formulation. Note that
  only minor differences are likely to be acceptable. Differences in container labelling need
  not normally be justified.
  Regulatory situation in other countries
  A listing should be provided of the countries in which this product has been granted a
  marketing authorization, this product has been withdrawn from the market and/or this
  application for marketing has been rejected, deferred or withdrawn (Module 1, 1.2.2).

  Page 78
  3.2. P.3.2 Batch formula (name, dosage form)
  A batch formula should be provided that includes a list of all components
  of the dosage form to be used in the manufacturing process, their amounts
  on a per batch basis, including overages, and a reference to their quality
  standards.
  The tables in the QOS-PD template should be used to summarize the batch formula
  of the FPP for each proposed commercial batch size and to express the quantity of
  each component on a per batch basis, including a statement of the total weight or
  measure of the batch.
  All components used in the manufacturing process should be included, including
  those that may not be added to every batch (e.g. acid and alkali), those that may
  be removed during processing (e.g. solvents) and any others (e.g. nitrogen or silicon
  for stoppers). If the FPP is formulated using an active moiety, then the composition
  for the active ingredient should be clearly indicated (e.g. “1 kg of active ingredient
  base = 1.075 kg active ingredient hydrochloride”). All overages should be clearly
  indicated (e.g. “Contains 5 kg (corresponding to 2%) overage of the API to
  compensate for manufacturing losses”).
  The components should be declared by their proper or common names, quality
  standards (e.g. BP, JP, and Ph.Eur. Ph.Int., USP, in-house) and, if applicable, their
  grades (e.g. “Microcrystalline cellulose NF (PH 102)”) and special technical
  characteristics (e.g. lyophilized, micronized, solubilized or emulsified).
  3.2. P.3.3 Description of manufacturing process and process controls (name,
  dosage form)
  A flow diagram should be presented giving the steps of the process and
  showing where materials enter the process. The critical steps and points
  Page 79
  at which process controls, intermediate tests or final product controls are
  conducted should be identified.
  A narrative description of the manufacturing process, including packaging
  that represents the sequence of steps undertaken and the scale of
  production should also be provided. Novel processes or technologies and
  packaging operations that directly affect product quality should be
  described with a greater level of detail. Equipment should, at least, be
  identified by type (e.g. tumble blender, in-line homogenizer) and working
  capacity, where relevant.
  Steps in the process should have the appropriate process parameters
  identified, such as time, temperature, or ph. associated numeric values
  can be presented as an expected range. Numeric ranges for critical steps
  should be justified in Section 3.2.P.3.4. In certain cases, environmental
  conditions (e.g. low humidity for an effervescent product) should be
  stated.
  The maximum holding time for bulk FPP prior to final packaging should be stated.
  The holding time should be supported by the submission of stability data if longer
  than 30 days. For an aseptically processed FPP, sterile filtration of the bulk and filling
  into final containers should preferably be continuous; any holding time should be
  justified.
  Proposals for the reprocessing of materials should be justified. Any data to
  support this justification should be either referenced or filed in this section
  (3.2.P.3.3).
  Page 80
  The information above should be summarized in the QOS-PD template and should reflect
  the production of the proposed commercial batches. See Glossary (section 2) for definitions
  of pilot-scale and production-scale batches.
  For the manufacture of sterile products, the class (e.g. A, B or C) of the areas should be
  stated for each activity (e.g. compounding, filling and sealing), as well as the sterilization
  parameters, including for equipment, container-closure system and terminal sterilization.
  Reference documents: ICH Q8, Q9, Q10.
  3.2. P.3.4 Controls of critical steps and intermediates (name, dosage form)
  Critical steps: Tests and acceptance criteria should be provided (with
  justification, including experimental data) performed at the critical steps
  identified in 3.2.P.3.3 of the manufacturing process, to ensure that the
  process is controlled.
  Intermediates: Information on the quality and control of intermediates
  isolated during the process should be provided.
  Examples of applicable in-process controls include:
  ▪ granulations: moisture (limits expressed as a range), blend uniformity (e.g.
  low-dose tablets), bulk and tapped densities and particle size distribution;
  ▪ solid oral products: average weight, weight variation, hardness, thickness,
  friability, and disintegration checked periodically throughout compression,
  weight gain during coating;
  ▪ semi-solids: viscosity, homogeneity, pH;
  ▪ transdermal dosage forms: assay of API–adhesive mixture, weight per area
  of coated patch without backing;
  ▪ metered dose inhalers: fill weight or volume, leak testing, valve delivery;
  Page 81
  ▪ dry powder inhalers: assay of API–excipient blend, moisture, weight variation
  of individually contained doses such as capsules or blisters;
  ▪ liquids: pH, specific gravity, clarity of solutions;
  ▪ parenterals: appearance, clarity, fill volume or weight, pH, filter integrity tests,
  particulate matter, leak testing of ampoules, prefiltration and/or pre-
  sterilization bioburden testing.
  Reference documents: ICH Q2, Q6A, Q8, Q9, Q10, WHO Technical Report Series, No. 929,
  Annex 5.
  3.2. P.3.5 Process validation and/or evaluation (name, dosage form)
  Description, documentation, and results of the validation and/or
  evaluation studies should be provided for critical steps or critical assays
  used in the manufacturing process (e.g. validation of the sterilization
  process or aseptic processing or filling). Viral safety evaluation should be
  provided in 3.2A.2, if necessary.
  For products that meet the criteria of an established multisource product, a product
  quality review as outlined in Appendix 2 may be submitted in lieu of the information
  below.
  The following information should be provided for all other products:

1. a copy of the process validation protocol, specific to this FPP, described below;
2. a commitment that three consecutive, production-scale batches of this FPP
   will be subjected to prospective validation in accordance with the above
   protocol. The applicant should submit a written commitment that information
   from these studies will be available for verification after prequalification by the
   NAFDAC inspection team;
3. if the process validation studies have already been conducted (e.g. for sterile
   products), a copy of the process validation report should be provided in the
   PD in lieu of 1. and 2. above.
   Page 82
   One of the most practical forms of process validation, mainly for nonsterile products,
   is the final testing of the product to an extent greater than that required in routine
   quality control. It may involve extensive sampling, far beyond that called for in
   routine quality control and testing to normal quality control specifications and often
   for certain parameters only. Thus, for instance, several hundred tablets per batch
   may be weighed to determine unit dose uniformity. The results are then analyzed
   statistically to verify the “normality” of the distribution and to determine the standard
   deviation from the average weight. Confidence limits for individual results and for
   batch homogeneity are also estimated. Strong assurance is provided that samples
   taken at random will meet regulatory requirements if the confidence limits are well
   within compendia specifications.
   Similarly, extensive sampling and testing may be performed with regard to any
   quality requirements. In addition, intermediate stages may be validated in the same
   way, e.g. dozens of samples may be assayed individually to validate mixing or
   granulation stages of low-dose tablet production by using the content uniformity test.
   Certain product characteristics may occasionally be skip-tested. Thus, subvisual
   particulate matter in parenteral preparations may be determined by means of
   electronic devices, or tablets or capsules tested for their dissolution profile if such
   tests are not performed on every batch.
   Where ranges of batch sizes are proposed, it should be shown that variations in batch
   size would not adversely alter the characteristics of the finished product. It is
   envisaged that those parameters listed in the following validation scheme would need
   to be revalidated once further scale-up is proposed after prequalification.
   The process validation protocol should include, but not be limited to, the following:
   – a reference to the current master production document;
   – a discussion of the critical equipment;
   Page 83
   – the process parameters that can affect the quality of the FPP (critical process
   parameters (CPPs)) including challenge experiments and failure mode
   operation;
   – details of the sampling: sampling points, stages of sampling, methods of
   sampling and the sampling plans (including schematics of blender or storage
   bins for uniformity testing of the final blend);
   – the testing parameters and acceptance criteria including in process and release
   specifications and comparative dissolution profiles of validation batches against
   the batch(es) used in the bioavailability or biowaiver studies;
   – the analytical procedures or a reference to appropriate section(s) of the
   dossier;
   – the methods for recording and evaluating results; – the proposed
   timeframe for completion of the protocol.
   The manufacture of sterile FPPs needs to take place in a well-controlled
   manufacturing area (e.g. a strictly controlled environment using highly reliable
   procedures and with appropriate in-process controls). A detailed description of these
   conditions, procedures and controls should be provided, together with actual copies
   of the standard operating procedures for the following:

- washing, treatment, sterilization and dehydrogenation of containers, closures
  and equipment;
- filtration of solutions;
- lyophilization process;
- leaker test of filled and sealed ampoules; – final inspection of the product; –
  sterilization cycle.
  The sterilization process used to destroy or remove microorganisms is probably the
  single most important process in the manufacture of parenteral FPPs. The process
  can make use of moist heat (e.g. steam), dry heat, filtration, gaseous sterilization
  (e.g. ethylene oxide) or radiation. It should be noted that terminal steam
  sterilization, when practical, is considered to be the method of choice to ensure
  Page 84
  sterility of the final FPP. Therefore, scientific justification for selecting any other
  method of sterilization should be provided.
  The sterilization process should be described in detail and evidence should be
  provided to confirm that it will produce a sterile product with a high degree of
  reliability and that the physical and chemical properties as well as the safety of the
  FPP will not be affected. Details such as Fo range, temperature range and peak dwell
  time for an FPP and the container-closure system should be provided. Although
  standard autoclaving cycles of 121 °C for 15 minutes or more would not need a
  detailed rationale, such justifications should be provided for reduced temperature
  cycles or elevated temperature cycles with shortened exposure times. If ethylene
  oxide is used, studies and acceptance criteria should control the levels of residual
  ethylene oxide and related compounds.
  Any filters used should be validated with respect to pore size, compatibility with the product,
  absence of extractables and lack of adsorption of the API or any of the components.
  For the validation of aseptic processing of parenteral products that cannot be terminally
  sterilized, simulation process trials should be conducted. This involves filling containers with
  culture media under normal conditions, followed by incubation. Refer to current NAFDAC or
  WHO GMP guidelines for details.

  WHO Technical Report Series, No. 961, Annex 3.
  3.2. P.4 Control of excipients (name, dosage form)
  3.2. P.4.1
  Specifications (name, dosage form)
  The specifications for excipients should be provided.
  Page 85
  The specifications from the applicant or the FPP manufacturer should be provided for all
  excipients, including those that may not be added to every batch (e.g. acid and alkali),
  those that do not appear in the final FPP (e.g. solvents) and any others used in the
  manufacturing process (e.g. nitrogen or silicon for stoppers).
  If the standard claimed for an excipient is an officially recognized compendia standard, it is
  sufficient to state that the excipient is tested according to the requirements of that standard,
  rather than reproducing the specifications found in the officially recognized compendia
  monograph.
  If the standard claimed for an excipient is a non-compendia standard (e.g. in-house
  standard) or includes tests that are supplementary to those appearing in the officially
  recognized compendia monograph, a copy of the specification for the excipient should be
  provided.
  For products submitted to NAFDAC for registration, only excipients with an officially
  recognized pharmacopoeia monograph should be used. Exceptions may be justified.
  For excipients of natural origin, microbial limit testing should be included in the
  specifications. Skip-testing is acceptable if justified (submission of acceptable results of five
  production batches).
  For oils of plant origin (e.g. soy bean oil or peanut oil) the absence of aflatoxins or biocides
  should be demonstrated.
  The colours permitted for use are limited to those listed in the “Japanese pharmaceutical
  excipients”, the European Union (EU) “List of permitted food colours”, and the FDA “Inactive
  ingredient guide”. For proprietary mixtures, the supplier’s product sheet with the qualitative
  formulation should be submitted, in addition to the FPP manufacturer’s specifications for
  the product, including identification testing.
  Page 86
  For flavours, the qualitative composition should be submitted, as well as a declaration that
  the excipients comply with foodstuff regulations (e.g. USA or EU regulations).
  Information that is considered confidential may be submitted directly to the NAFDAC by the
  supplier who should make reference in the cover letter to the specific related product.
  Other certifications of at-risk components may be required on a case-by-case basis.
  If additional purification is undertaken on commercially available excipients, details of the
  process of purification and modified specifications should be submitted.
  Reference documents: ICH Q6A.
  3.2. P.4.2
  Analytical procedures (name, dosage form)
  The analytical procedures used for testing the excipients should be
  provided, where appropriate.
  Copies of analytical procedures from officially recognized compendia monographs do not
  need to be submitted.
  Reference document: ICH Q2.
  3.2. P.4.3
  Validation of analytical procedures (name, dosage form)
  Analytical validation information, including experimental data, for the
  analytical procedures used for testing the excipients should be provided,
  where appropriate.
  Copies of analytical validation information are generally not submitted for the testing
  of excipients, with the exception of the validation of in-house methods where
  appropriate.
  Page 87
  Reference document: ICH Q2.
  3.2. P.4.4
  Justification of specifications (name, dosage form)
  Justification for the proposed excipient specifications should be provided,
  where appropriate.
  A discussion of the tests that are supplementary to those appearing in the officially
  recognized compendia monograph should be provided.
  3.2. P.4.5
  Excipients of human or animal origin (name, dosage form)
  For excipients of human or animal origin, information should be provided
  regarding adventitious agents (e.g. sources, specifications, description of
  the testing performed, and viral safety data) (details in 3.2.A.2).
  The following excipients should be addressed in this section: gelatin, phosphates,
  stearic acid, magnesium stearate and other stearates. If the excipients are of plant
  origin a declaration to this effect will suffice.
  For excipients of animal origin, a letter of attestation should be provided confirming
  that the excipients used to manufacture the FPP are without risk of transmitting
  agents of animal spongiform encephalopathies.
  Materials of animal origin should be avoided whenever possible.
  When available a CEP demonstrating TSE-compliance should be provided. A
  complete copy of the CEP (including any annexes) should be provided in Module 1.

    3.2. P.4.6
    Novel excipients (name, dosage form)
    For excipient(s) used for the first time in an FPP or by a new route of
    administration, full details of manufacture, characterization, and controls,
    with cross-references to supporting safety data (non-clinical and/or
    clinical) should be provided according to the API and/or FPP format
    (details in 3.2.A.3).
    Novel excipients are not accepted by NAFDAC. For the purpose of these guidelines,
    a novel excipient is one that has not been used (at a similar level and by the same
    route of administration) in a product approved by an SRA or by WHO.
    3.2. P.5 Control of FPP (name, dosage form)
    3.2. P.5.1
    Specification(s) (name, dosage form)
    The specification(s) for the FPP should be provided.
    As defined in ICH’s Q6A guideline, a specification is:
    ‘‘a list of tests, references to analytical procedures and appropriate acceptance
    criteria, which are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests
    described. It establishes the set of criteria to which an API or FPP should
    conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. “Conformance to
    specifications” means that the API and/or FPP, when tested according to the
    listed analytical procedures, will meet the listed acceptance criteria.
    Specifications are critical quality standards that are proposed and justified by
    the manufacturer and approved by regulatory authorities.’’
    A copy of the FPP specification(s) from the applicant (as well as the company responsible
    for the batch release of the FPP, if different from the applicant), dated and signed by
    authorized personnel (i.e. the person in charge of the quality control or quality assurance
    Page 89
    department) should be provided in the PD. Two separate sets of specifications may be set
    out: after packaging of the FPP (release) and at the end of the shelf-life.
    The specifications should be summarized according to the tables in the QOS-PD template
    including the tests, acceptance criteria and analytical procedures (listing types, sources and
    versions for the methods).
    ▪ he standard declared by the applicant could be an officially recognized compendia
    standard (e.g. BP, JP, Ph.Eur. Ph.Int., USP) or an in-house (manufacturer’s) standard.
    ▪ The specification reference number and version (e.g. revision number and/or date)
    should be provided for version control purposes.
    ▪ For the analytical procedures, the type should indicate the kind of analytical procedure
    used (e.g. visual, IR, UV or HPLC); the source refers to the origin of the analytical
    procedure (e.g. BP, JP, Ph.Eur. Ph.Int., USP, in-house) and the version (e.g. code
    number/version/ date) should be provided for version control purposes.
    ICH’s Q6A guideline outlines recommendations for a number of
    universal and
    specific tests
    and criteria for FPPs. Specifications should include, at a minimum, tests for appearance,
    identification, assay, purity, performance tests (e.g. dissolution), physical tests (e.g. loss on
    drying, hardness, friability and particle size), uniformity of dosage units, and, as applicable,
    identification and assay of antimicrobial or chemical preservatives (e.g. antioxidants) and
    microbial limit tests.
    The following information provides guidance on specific tests that are not addressed by
    ICH’s Q6A guideline:
    ▪ fixed-dose combination FPPs (FDC-FPPs):

- analytical methods that can distinguish each API in the presence of the other
  API(s) should be developed and validated,
- acceptance criteria for degradation products should be established with
  reference to the API they are derived from. If an impurity results from a
  chemical reaction between two or more APIs, its acceptance limits should in
  Page 90
  general be calculated with reference to the worst case (the API with the smaller
  area under the curve). Alternatively the content of such impurities could be
  calculated in relation to their reference standards,
- a test and limit for content uniformity is required for each API present in the
  FPP at less than 5 mg or less than 5% of the weight of the dosage unit,
- for the API(s) present at ≥ 5 mg and ≥ 5% of the weight of the dosage unit,
  a test and limit for weight variation may be established in lieu of content
  uniformity testing;
  ▪ modified-release products: a meaningful API release method;
  ▪ inhalation and nasal products: consistency of delivered dose (throughout the use of
  the product), particle or droplet size distribution profiles (comparable to the
  product used in in vivo studies where applicable) and if applicable for the dosage
  form, moisture content, leak rate, microbial limits, preservative assay, sterility and
  weight loss;
  ▪ suppositories: uniformity of dosage units, melting point;
  ▪ transdermal dosage forms: peel or shear force, mean weight per unit area and
  dissolution.
  Unless there is appropriate justification, the acceptable limit for the API content of the FPP
  in the release specifications is ± 5% of the label claim (i.e. 95.0–105.0%).
  For products such as tablets, capsules and suppositories where a test for uniformity of
  single-dose preparations is required, a test and limit for content uniformity is required when
  the API is present in the FPP at less than 5 mg or less than 5% of the weight of the dosage
  unit. Otherwise, the test for mass uniformity may be applied.
  Skip-testing is acceptable for parameters such as identification of colouring materials and
  microbial limits, when justified by the submission of acceptable supportive results for five
  production batches. When justification for skip-testing has been accepted the specifications
  should include a footnote, stating, at a minimum, the following skip-testing requirements:
  at least every tenth batch and at least one batch annually is tested. In addition, for stability
  Page 91
  indicating parameters such as microbial limits, testing will be performed at release and at
  the end of shelf-life during stability studies.
  Any differences between release and shelf-life tests and acceptance criteria should be
  clearly indicated and justified. Note that such differences for parameters such as dissolution
  are normally not accepted.
  Reference documents: ICH Q3B, Q3C, Q6A.
  3.2. P.5.2
  Analytical procedures (name, dosage form)
  The analytical procedures used for testing the FPP should be provided.
  Copies of the in-house analytical procedures used during pharmaceutical
  development (if used to generate testing results provided in the PD) as well as those
  proposed for routine testing should be provided. Unless modified it is not necessary
  to provide copies of analytical procedures described in officially recognized
  compendia.
  Tables for summarizing a number of the different analytical procedures and the
  validation information (e.g. HPLC assay and impurity methods) can be found in the
  2.3.R Regional information section of the QOS-PD (i.e. 2.3.R.2). These tables should
  be used to summarize the analytical procedures used for determination of the assay,
  related substances and dissolution of the FPP.
  Refer to section 3.2.S.4.2 of these guidelines for additional guidance on analytical
  procedures.
  Reference document: ICH Q2 (
  16).
  Page 92
  3.2. P.5.3
  Validation of analytical procedures (name, dosage form)
  Analytical validation information, including experimental data, for the
  analytical procedures used for testing the FPP, should be provided.
  Copies of the validation reports for the in-house analytical procedures used during
  pharmaceutical development (if used to support testing results provided in the PD)
  as well as those proposed for routine testing should be provided.
  Tables for summarizing a number of the different analytical procedures and
  validation information (e.g. HPLC assay and impurity methods, and GC methods) can
  be found in the 2.3.R Regional information section of the QOSPD (i.e.
  2.3.R.2). These
  tables should be used to summarize the validation information of the analytical
  procedures used for determination of the assay, related substances and dissolution
  of the FPP.
  As recognized by regulatory authorities and pharmacopoeias themselves, verification
  of compendia methods can be necessary. The compendia methods as published are
  typically validated based on an API or an FPP originating from a specific
  manufacturer. The same API or FPP obtained from different sources can contain
  impurities and/or degradation products or excipients that were not considered during
  the development of the monograph. Therefore, the monograph and compendia
  method(s) should be demonstrated suitable for the control of the proposed FPP.
  For officially recognized compendia FPP assay methods, verification should include a
  demonstration of specificity, accuracy and repeatability (method precision). If an
  officially recognized compendia method is used to control related substances that
  are not specified in the monograph, full validation of the method is expected with
  respect to those related substances.

  If an officially recognized compendia standard is claimed and an in-house method is
  used in lieu of the compendia method (e.g. for assay or for related compounds),
  equivalence of the in-house and compendia methods should be demonstrated. This
  could be accomplished by performing duplicate analyses of one sample by both
  methods and providing the results from the study. For methods for the determination
  of related compounds, the sample analyzed should be the placebo spiked with
  related compounds at concentrations equivalent to their specification limits.
  Reference document: ICH Q2.
  3.2. P.5.4
  Batch analyses (name, dosage form)
  A description of batches and results of batch analyses should be provided.
  Information on relevant FPP batches used to establish the specifications and evaluate
  consistency in manufacturing should be provided and should include strength and
  batch number, batch size, date and site of production and use (e.g. used in
  comparative bioavailability or biowaiver studies, preclinical and clinical studies (if
  relevant), stability, pilot, scale-up and, if available, production-scale batches).
  Analytical results generated by the company responsible for the batch release of the
  FPP (generally the applicant or the FPP manufacturer, if different from the applicant)
  should be provided for not less than two batches of at least pilot scale, or in the case
  of an uncomplicated1 FPP (e.g. immediate-release solid FPPs (with noted
  exceptions), or non-sterile solutions), at least one batch of at least pilot scale and a
  second batch which may be smaller (e.g. for solid oral dosage forms, 25 000 or 50
  000 tablets or capsules) of each proposed strength of the FPP. These batches should
  be manufactured by a procedure fully representative of and simulating that to be
  applied to a full production-scale batch.
  1 The term “complicated FPP” includes sterile products, metered dose inhaler products, dry powder inhaler products and transdermal
  delivery systems. Other specific products under “complicated FPP” include ritonavir/lopinavir FDC tablets and FDCs containing
  rifampicin or an artemisinin.
  Page 94
  The results should include those of tests on the batch (es) used in the comparative
  bioavailability or biowaiver studies. Copies of the certificates of analysis for these
  batches should be provided in the PD and the company responsible for generating
  the testing results should be identified.
  The discussion of results should focus on observations noted for the various tests,
  rather than reporting comments such as “all tests meet specifications”. The
  discussion should include ranges of analytical results, where relevant. For
  quantitative tests (e.g. individual and total impurity tests and assay tests), it should
  be ensured that actual numerical results are provided rather than vague statements
  such as “within limits” or “conforms” (e.g. “levels of degradation product A ranged
  from 0.2 to 0.4 %”). Dissolution results should be expressed, at a minimum, as both
  the average and the range of individual results. Recommendations for conducting
  and assessing comparative dissolution profiles can be found in Appendix 1.
  A discussion and justification should be provided for any incomplete analyses (e.g.
  for any parameters not tested according to the proposed specification).
  Reference documents: ICH Q3B, Q3C, Q6A.
  3.2. P.5.5
  Characterization of impurities (name, dosage form)
  Information on the characterization of impurities should be provided, if
  not previously provided in “3.2.S.3.2 Impurities”.
  A discussion should be provided of all impurities that are potential degradation
  products (including those among the impurities identified in 3.2.S.3.2 as well as
  potential degradation products resulting from interaction of the API with other APIs
  Page 95
  (FDCs), excipients or the container-closure system) and FPP process-related
  impurities (e.g. residual solvents in the manufacturing process for the FPP).
  Reference documents: ICH Q3B, Q3C, Q6A.
  3.2. P.5.6
  Justification of specification(s) (name, dosage form)
  Justification for the proposed FPP specification(s) should be provided.
  A discussion should be provided on the omission or inclusion of certain tests,
  evolution of tests, analytical procedures and acceptance criteria, and differences
  from the officially recognized compendia standard(s). If the officially recognized
  compendia methods have been modified or replaced, a discussion should be
  included.
  The justification for certain tests, analytical procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g.
  degradation products or dissolution method development) may have been discussed
  in other sections of the PD and would not need to be repeated here, although a
  cross-reference should be provided.
  ICH Q6A should be consulted for the development of specifications for FPPs.
  3.2. P.6 Reference standards or materials (name, dosage form)
  Information on the reference standards or reference materials used for
  testing of the FPP should be provided, if not previously provided in “3.2.S.5
  Reference standards or materials”.
  See section 3.2.S.5 for information that should be provided on reference standards
  or materials. Information should be provided on reference materials of FPP
  degradation products, where not included in 3.2.S.5.

3.  3.2. P.7 Container-closure system (name, dosage form)
    A description of the container-closure systems should be provided, including the
    identity of materials of construction of each primary packaging component and
    its specification. The specifications should include description and identification
    (and critical dimensions, with drawings where appropriate). Non-compendia
    methods (with validation) should be included, where appropriate.
    For non-functional secondary packaging components (e.g. those that neither
    provide additional protection nor serve to deliver the product), only a brief
    description should be provided. For functional secondary packaging
    components, additional information should be provided.
    Suitability information should be located in 3.2.P.2.
    The WHO
    Guidelines on packaging for pharmaceutical products (

18) and the officially
    recognized pharmacopoeias should be consulted for recommendations on the packaging
    information for FPPs.
    Descriptions, materials of construction and specifications (of the company responsible for
    packaging the FPP, generally the FPP manufacturer) should be provided for the packaging
    components that are:
    ▪ in direct contact with the dosage form (e.g. container, closure, liner, desiccant and
    filler);
    ▪ used for drug delivery (including the device(s) for multidose solutions, emulsions,
    suspensions and powders or granules for reconstitution into solution, emulsion or
    suspension;
    ▪ used as a protective barrier to help ensure stability or sterility;
    Page 97
    ▪ necessary to ensure FPP quality during storage and shipping.
    Primary packaging components are those that are in direct contact with the API or FPP.
    The specifications for the primary packaging components should include a specific test for
    identification (e.g. IR). Specifications for film and foil materials should include limits for
    thickness or area weight.
    Information to establish the suitability (e.g. qualification) of the container closure system
    should be discussed in section 3.2.P.2. Comparative studies may be warranted for certain
    changes in packaging components (e.g. a comparative delivery study (droplet size) for a
    change in manufacturer of dropper tips).
    3.2. P.8 Stability (name, dosage form)
    3.2. P.8.1 Stability summary and conclusions (name, dosage form)
    The types of studies conducted, protocols used, and the results of the
    studies should be summarized. The summary should include, for example,
    conclusions with respect to storage conditions and shelf-life, and, if
    applicable, in-use storage conditions and shelf-life.
    The WHO stability guidelines
    Stability testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients
    and finished pharmaceutical products (
19) should be consulted for recommendations
    on the core stability data package required for the prequalification of APIs and FPPs.
    As outlined in the WHO stability guidelines, the purpose of stability testing is to
    provide evidence of how the quality of an API or FPP varies with time under the
    influence of a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and
    light. The stability programme also includes the study of product related factors that
    influence the quality of the API or FPP, for example, interaction of API with
    excipients, container-closure systems and packaging materials.
    Page 98
    Stress
    testing
    As outlined in the WHO stability guidelines, photo stability testing should be conducted on
    at least one primary batch of the FPP if appropriate. If “protect from light” is stated in one
    of the officially recognized pharmacopoeias for the API or FPP it is sufficient to state “protect
    from light” on labelling, in lieu of photo stability studies, when the container-closure system
    is shown to be light protective. Additional stress testing of specific types of dosage forms
    may be appropriate (e.g. cyclic studies for semi-solid products or freeze–thaw studies for
    liquid products).
    Accelerated, intermediate (if necessary) and long-term testing
    Stability data must demonstrate stability of the medicinal product throughout its intended
    shelf-life under the climatic conditions prevalent in the target countries. Merely applying the
    same requirements applicable to other markets could potentially lead to substandard
    products if stability studies are conducted at the storage conditions for countries in Climatic
    Zone I/II when the products are supplied in countries in Climatic Zones III and IV. Refer toWHO Technical Report Series, No. 953, Annex 2, Appendix 1 (
20) for information on climatic
    zones. Effective as of September 2011, the required long-term storage conditions for the
    WHO Prequalification of Medicines Programmed are 30 ºC ± 2 ºC/75% ± 5% RH, and after
    this date the long-term data submitted in the PD (see Table 3) should be at these conditions.
    The use of alternative long-term conditions will need to be justified and should be supported
    with appropriate evidence.
    Other storage conditions are outlined in the WHO stability guidelines for FPPs
    packaged in impermeable and semi-permeable containers and those intended for storage
    in a refrigerator and in a freezer. FPPs intended for storage below −20 °C should be treated
    on a case-by-case basis.

    Refer to
    WHO Technical Report Series, No. 953, Annex 2 (
21) for further information
    regarding the storage conditions.
    To establish the shelf-life, data should be provided on not less than two batches of at least
    pilot scale, or in the case of an uncomplicated FPP (e.g. immediate-release solid FPPs (with
    noted exceptions) or non-sterile solutions), at least one batch of at least pilot scale and a
    second batch which may be smaller (e.g. for solid oral dosage forms, 25 000 or 50 000
    tablets or capsules) of each proposed strength of the FPP. These batches should be
    manufactured by a procedure fully representative of and simulating that to be applied to a
    full production-scale batch.
    The stability testing programme should be summarized and the results of stability testing
    should be reported in the dossier and summarized in the tables in the QOS-PD. Bracketing
    and matrixing of proportional strengths can be applied if scientifically justified.
    For sterile products, sterility should be reported at the beginning and end of shelf-life. For
    parenteral products, sub visible particulate matter should be reported frequently, but not
    Page 100
    necessarily at every test interval. Bacterial endotoxins need only be reported at the initial
    test point. Weight loss from plastic containers should be reported over the shelf-life.
    Any in-use period and associated storage conditions should be justified with experimental
    data, for example, after opening, reconstitution and/or dilution of any sterile and/or
    multidose products or after first opening of FPPs packed in bulk multidose containers (e.g.
    bottles of 1000s). If applicable, the in-use period and storage conditions should be stated
    in the product information.
    The information on the stability studies should include details such as

- storage conditions;
- strength;
- batch number, including the API batch number(s) and manufacturer(s);
- batch size;
- container-closure system including orientation (e.g. erect, inverted, on-side)
  where applicable;
- completed (and proposed) test intervals.
  The discussion of results should focus on observations noted for the various tests, rather
  than reporting comments such as “all tests meet specifications”. The discussion should
  include ranges of analytical results and any trends that were observed. For quantitative
  tests (e.g. individual and total degradation product tests and assay tests) actual numerical
  results should be provided rather than vague statements such as “within limits” or
  “conforms”. Dissolution results should be expressed, at a minimum, as both the average
  and range of individual results.
  Applicants should consult ICH’s Q1E guideline (

23. for details on the evaluation and
    extrapolation of results from stability data (e.g. if significant change was not observed within
    6 months at accelerated condition and the data show little or no variability, the proposed
    Page 101
    shelf-life could be up to twice the period covered by the long-term data, but should not
    exceed the long-term data by more than 12 months).
    Proposed storage statement and shelf-life
    The proposed storage statement and shelf-life (and in-use storage conditions and in-use
    period, if applicable) for the FPP should be provided.
    The recommended labelling statements for use based on the stability studies, are provided
    in the WHO stability guidelines.

    3.2. P.8.2
    Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment (name,
    dosage form)
    The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment should be
    provided.Primary stability study commitment
    When the available data on long-term stability of primary batches do not cover the proposed
    shelf-life granted at the time of assessment of the PD, a commitment should be made to
    continue the stability studies in order to firmly establish the shelf-life. A written commitment
    (signed and dated) to continue long-term testing over the shelf-life period should be
    included in the dossier.
    Commitment stability studies
    The long-term stability studies for the commitment batches should be conducted
    throughout the proposed shelf-life on at least three production batches of each strength in
    each container-closure system. Where stability data were not provided for three production
    Page 102
    batches of each strength, a written commitment (signed and dated) should be included in
    the dossier.
    Ongoing stability studies
    As described in the WHO stability guidelines, an ongoing stability programme is established
    to monitor the product over its shelf-life and to determine that the product remains and can
    be expected to remain within specifications under the storage conditions on the label.
    Unless otherwise justified, at least one batch per year of product manufactured in every
    strength and every container-closure system, if relevant, should be included in the stability
    programme (unless none is produced during that year). Bracketing and matrixing may be
    applicable. A written commitment (signed and dated) to this effect should be included in
    the dossier.
    Any differences between the stability protocols used for the primary batches and those
    proposed for the commitment batches or ongoing batches should be scientifically justified.
    Reference document: ICH Q1A.
    3.2. P.8.3
    Stability data (name, dosage form)
    Results of the stability studies should be presented in an appropriate format
    (e.g. tabular, graphical, and narrative). Information on the analytical
    procedures used to generate the data and validation of these procedures
    should be included.
    Information on characterization of impurities is located in 3.2. P.5.5.
    The actual stability results and reports used to support the proposed shelf-life should be
    provided in the PD. For quantitative tests (e.g. individual and total degradation product
    Page 103
    tests and assay tests), actual numerical results should be provided rather than vague
    statements such as “within limits” or “conforms”.
    Dissolution results should be expressed, at a minimum, as both the average and range of
    individual results.

    the comparative bioavailability or biowaiver studies. Any notations made by operators on
    the executed production documents should be clearly legible.
    If not included in the executed batch records through sufficient in process testing, data
    should be provided for the batch used in comparative bioavailability or biowaiver studies
    that demonstrate the uniformity of this batch. The data to establish the uniformity of the
    bio batch should involve testing to an extent greater than that required in routine quality
    control.
    English translations of executed records should be provided where relevant.
    3.2.R.1.2
    Master production documents
    Copies of the FPP master production documents should be provided for each

    Module 5: Clinical Summaries
    For multisource (generic) pharmaceutical products, only
    Module 5.3.1 Reports of
    Biopharmaceutical Studies would normally be needed. However, all parts of the
    module are included for completeness to indicate the appropriate format and
    placement of the nonclinical data.
    ICH E3 provides guidance on the organisation of clinical study reports, other clinical
    data, and references within a Common Technical Document (CTD).
    Page 109
    Module 5 provides the recommended organization for the placement of clinical study
    reports and related information to simplify preparation and review of dossiers and to
    ensure completeness. The placement of a report should be determined by the
    primary objective of the study. Each study report should appear in only one section.
    Where there are multiple objectives, the study should be cross-referenced in the
    various sections. An explanation such as “not applicable” or “no study conducted”
    should be provided when no report or information is available for a section or
    subsection.
    Refer to ICH M4E (R2) for additional detail on the organization of Module 5 and for
    additional ICH references on study design and data content.
    5.1 Table of Contents (Module 5)
    A Table of Contents for study reports should be provided.
    5.2 Tabular Listing of Clinical Studies
    5.3 Clinical Study Reports
    5.3.1 Reports of Bio-pharmaceutic Studies
    Bioavailability (BA) studies evaluate the rate and extent of release of the active
    substance from the medicinal product. Comparative BA or bioequivalence (BE)
    studies may use Pharmacokinetic (PK), Pharmacodynamic (PD), clinical or in vitro
    dissolution endpoints, and may be either single dose or multiple doses. When the
    primary purpose of a study is to assess the PK of a drug, but also includes BA
    information, the study report should be submitted in Section 5.3.1, and referenced
    in Sections 5.3.1.1 and/or 5.3.1.2.
    5.3.1.1 Bioavailability (BA) Study Reports
    BA studies in this section should include
    • studies comparing the release and systemic availability of a drug substance from
    a solid oral dosage form to the systemic availability of the drug substance given
    intravenously or as an oral liquid dosage form
    Page 110
    • dosage form proportionality studies, and
    • food-effect studies.
    5.3.1.2
    Comparative Bioavailability (BA) and Bioequivalence (BE) Study Reports
    Studies in this section compare the rate and extent of release of the drug substance
    from similar drug products (e.g., tablet to tablet, tablet to capsule). Comparative BA
    or BE studies may include comparisons between
    • the drug product used in clinical studies supporting effectiveness and the to-be-
    marketed drug product,
    • the drug product used in clinical studies supporting effectiveness and the drug
    product used in stability batches, and
    • similar drug products from different manufacturers.
    5.3.1.3
    In vitro-In vivo Correlation Study Reports
    In vitro dissolution studies that provide BA information, including studies used in
    seeking to correlate in vitro data with in vivo correlations, should be placed in this
    section. Reports of in vitro dissolution tests used for batch quality control and/or
    batch release should be placed in the Quality section (module 3) of the CTD.
    5.3.1.4
    Reports of Bioanalytical and Analytical Methods for Human Studies
    Bioanalytical and/or analytical methods for biopharmaceutics studies or in vitro

    Appendix 1
    Recommendations for conducting and assessing comparative dissolution
    profiles
    The dissolution measurements of the two FPPs (e.g. test and reference (comparator) or
    two different strengths) should be made under the same test conditions. A minimum of
    three time-points (zero excluded) should be included, the time-points for both reference
    (comparator) and test product being the same. The sampling intervals should be short for
    a scientifically sound comparison of the profiles (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 (60, 90, 120)
    minutes). The 15-minute time-point is critical to determine whether a product is very rapidly
    dissolving and to determine whether f2 must be calculated. For extended release FPPs, the
    Page 113
    time-points should be set to cover the entire duration of expected release, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5
    and 8 hours for a 12-hour release and additional test intervals for longer duration of release.
    Studies should be performed in at least three media covering the physiological range,
    including pH 1.2 hydrochloric acid, pH 4.5 buffer and pH 6.8 buffer.
    International
    Pharmacopoeia buffers are recommended; other pharmacopoeia buffers with the same pH
    and buffer capacity are also accepted. Water may be considered as an additional medium,
    especially when the API is unstable in the buffered media to the extent that the data are
    unusable.
    If both the test and reference (comparator) products show more than 85%
    dissolution in 15 minutes, the profiles are considered similar (no calculations required).
    Otherwise:
    ▪ Similarity of the resulting comparative dissolution profiles should be calculated
    using the following equation that defines a similarity factor (f2):
    f2 = 50 LOG {[1+1/n ∑nt=1 (Rt−Tt) 2] −0.5 × 100}
    where Rt and Tt are the mean per cent API dissolved in reference (comparator)
    and test product, respectively, at each time-point. An f2 value between 50 and
    100 suggests that the two dissolution profiles are similar.
    ▪ A maximum of one time-point should be considered after 85% dissolution of the
    reference (comparator) product has been reached. In the case where 85%
    dissolution cannot be reached due to poor solubility of the API, the dissolution
    should be conducted until an asymptote (plateau) has been reached.
    ▪ At least 12 units should be used for determination of each profile. Mean dissolution
    values can be used to estimate the similarity factor, f2. To use mean data, the
    percentage coefficient of variation at the first time-point should be not more than
    20% and at other time-points should be not more than 10%.
    ▪ When delayed-release products (e.g. enteric coated) are being compared, the
    recommended conditions are acid medium (pH 1.2) for 2 hours and buffer pH 6.8
    medium.
    Page 114
    ▪ When comparing extended-release beaded capsules, where different strengths
    have been achieved solely by means of adjusting the number of beads containing
    the API, one condition (normally the release condition) will suffice.
    ▪ Surfactants should be avoided in comparative dissolution testing. A statement that
    the API is not soluble in any of the media is not sufficient and profiles in the
    absence of surfactant should be provided. The rationale for the choice and
    concentration of surfactant should be provided. The concentration of the
    surfactant should be such that the discriminatory power of the test will not be
    compromised.
